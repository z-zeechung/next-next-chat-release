What is your main goal the next 3 months?\n   \n   2.9. Define side quests.\n   \n   2.10. Write everything down to visualize your workload and prioritize.\n   \n   2.11. A clear week for a clear mind.\n   \n   2.12. Don’t GET interrupted CHOOSE to be.\n   \n   2.13. Don’t multitask.\n   \n   2.14. Never accept a brief if you don’t understand why.\n   \n   2.15. Urgent is almost never urgent.\n   \n   2.16. Work small and iterate.\n   \n   2.17. Finishing a task is just the beginning.\n   \n   2.18. Impatience with actions patience with results.\n   \n   2.19. What to do when you lose touch?\n\n3. **How we work**\n   \n   3.1. Practices.\n   \n   3.2. Disagree and commit.\n   \n   3.3.
