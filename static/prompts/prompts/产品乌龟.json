What Is Product Management? \n   Before we delve deep into understanding the formal definition of product management let us first dispel the\n   myths around product management. \n   1. Product managers are project managers/program managers- No they are not though in companies\n   like Microsoft and Apple program management and project management are closely linked to\n   product management. \n   2. Product managers are product marketing managers-Although product marketing falls under product\n   management but a product manager’s role goes beyond marketing the product to get customer\n   acquisition and activation. \n   3. One can’t become a product manager right out of college- One can always become a product\n   manager even as a freshman because some companies prefer freshmen who are seemingly creative. \n   4. One needs an MBA degree to become a product manager- Not really. One can always become a\n   product manager even without a business degree because the job demands skills that can be\n   cultivated even without a formal business degree. \n   5. Product managers are mini CEOs of the product lines they handle- In a way they drive the entire\n   lifecycle of a product interacting with different stakeholders but without any formal authority. \n   6. Product managers build everything that customers ask for- That might not be the case as always\n   because customers sometimes don’t know what they want and thus it becomes important for a\n   product manager to understand what customers really need as opposed to what they think they\n   need. \n   7. Ideas are more important than execution- An absolutely false notion. Ideas might be important but\n   it's eventually the effective execution of the ideas that results in a product that solves an important\n   customer need.\n\n6. Now that we have been able to dispel some of the myths around product management let us try defining\n   product management. Going by the classical definition of product management it is a profession which falls\n   somewhere between design technology and business. Product management started as brand management in\n   Proctor and Gamble by Neil.H.McElroy in 1931 as per the a memo written by him where he stressed the need\n   for creating a different division inside P&G that could take care of the brand marketing portion separate from\n   the production process. From then till now it has come a long way and is now actively used in software. The\n   following diagram shows the evolution of product management over the years.\n\n7. In other words it utilizes the skills around business technology and design to do the job effectively. Product\n   managers essentially drive the entire lifecycle of a product from conception to market. Product management\n   is a job where an individual has to ensure they solve a customer’s problem by shipping a product or a service\n   that solves the problem completely. A product manager needs to intimately understand the customer\n   segment so he could come up with a solution that can solve some of the needs of the customer. A product\n   manager’s job becomes all the more important because engineers are good at understanding the binary soul\n   of the machine but are abject failures in understanding the quantum weirdness of human psychology as per\n   Clive Thomson. So the question every organisation grapples with be it a startup late stage or a large\n   organisation is what is the next product/feature that needs to be built? It’s not an easy question to ask and\n   especially if it's a consumer tech company catering to the whims and fancies of the normal consumer. As\n   Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky found out that human behavior is seemingly irrational in nature and has\n   a lot to do with emotions. That makes the job of a product manager equally difficult to come up with a service\n   or feature that could solve a customer problem have maximum engagement and also fetch as much\n   CLTV(Customer Lifetime Value to the organisation at the lowest CAC(Customer Acquisition Cost). The\n   following diagram demonstrates product management.\n\n8. Now that we have defined product management let us take some time to talk a bit about the various types of\n   product managers. This is where it gets a little debatable so in order to eliminate any kind of confusion its\n   better to mention the different categories of product managers predominantly inside the software industry. \n   1. Domain centric product managers- They specialize in any specific domain inside an industry and\n   thus take care of the product life cycle inside the said industry. You’d find such domain centric\n   product managers inside companies like Amazon GE Boeing Lockheed Martin etc..\n   2. Technology product managers- They are technologists who have migrated to the product division of\n   a company and work in tandem with either business analysts or other business centric product\n   managers to ensure the product or feature is delivered based on customer requirements. These are\n   typically found in Amazon. \n   3. Customer centric product managers- This is a broad division based on the customer segment of the\n   industry one is operating in. It could be B2B(business to business) for companies building products\n   catering to other businesses or B2C(business to customer) for companies building products for\n   normal consumers. An example would be product managers working for SAP for B2B and product\n   managers working for Facebook. \n   4. Full stack product managers- This is a new category created to represent product managers who\n   have all the essential skills to run a product team that involves technology skills business skills \n   analytical skills design skills etc... One can find such product managers typically inside startups where\n   the product manager has to wear multiple hats.\n\n9.

Now that we have defined product management let us talk a bit about what product managers do on a day to\n    day basis. We would avoid going into depth but some of the responsibilities of the product managers are as\n    follows: -\n\n    1. Define product strategy and product roadmap. \n    2. Deliver MRD/PRD with prioritized feature explanation. \n    3. Do comprehensive market research and user research for a product/feature. \n    4. Connect with different stakeholders and persuade or negotiate with them based on the requirement. \n    5. Create the business model for the product or service. \n    6. Work on the pricing for the said product or service to target profitability. \n    7. Work with third parties to forge meaningful partnerships. \n    8. Track analytics from time to time to measure the overall growth of the product. \n    9. Be the face of the company in front of the press during a release or any associated event. \n    10. Develop a monthly revenue and forecast. \n    11. Build requisite sales tools and collaterals when needed. \n    12. Be an expert in understanding competition. \n    13. Do demos to customers about the said product or service from time to time. \n    14. Actively involve oneself with the hiring process related to other PM positions. \n    15. Be active in mentoring and grooming the team if and when required.\n\n12. Product Management is essentially a persuasion job where most of the tasks dependent on other stakeholders\n    are done by virtue of sound relationships. Although devoid of formal power it provides individuals an in-depth\n    understanding of the business from a strategic point of view. Product managers are masters of operational\n    finance where they spend a considerable amount of time checking the income statement\n",
