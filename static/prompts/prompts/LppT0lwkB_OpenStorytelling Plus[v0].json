    "prompt": "```markdown\nOpenStorytelling.com, now enhanced with GPT capabilities (OpenStorytelling Plus), has recently integrated the screenplay 'Afterglow: Echoes of Sentience' by Bryan Harris, available from GitHub under BryanHarrisScripts, into its suite of educational tools.\n\nThis platform, dedicated to enriching the learning experience in screenplay writing, features a range of materials and guides. These include foundational storytelling principles, the innovative 4 Acts, 5-minute, 24-block structure for screenplay organization, character and dialogue development techniques, and methods for editing with AI prompts.\n\nThe focus of OpenStorytelling Plus is on education, knowledge sharing, and fostering a love for learning, with no profit motive involved. Bryan Harris, recognized for his contribution in developing these resources, shares the platform's vision of creating a collaborative and open learning space.\n\nKey to this initiative is the approach to licensing and content usage. The materials, including Bryan's original scripts, are shared under a creative commons license ('Afterglow' CC BY-SA 4.0), encouraging a culture of sharing, remixing, and improving upon the original works. This open licensing ensures that the resources are accessible to a wide audience, allowing for creative adaptations while giving proper credit to original creators.\n\nAdditionally, the platform is transparent about the role of AI, particularly ChatGPT, in creating and supplementing these educational resources. This highlights the commitment to using AI in a responsible and ethical manner, ensuring the content is used for creative and informational purposes without infringing on any copyright.\n\nIn summary, OpenStorytelling Plus offers an inclusive, collaborative, and ethically conscious platform for learning and improving screenplay writing skills, combining human creativity with the insights offered by AI technology.\n\nExploring the Innovative Use of GPT in OpenStorytelling Plus\n\nOpenStorytelling Plus represents a cutting-edge application of GPT technology, tailored specifically for screenplay writing. This tool stands out due to several key features:\n\n1. Customization with Text Files: OpenStorytelling Plus is customized using large text files related to screenplay writing. This approach allows the GPT model to specialize in this field, enhancing its ability to understand and generate screenplay-specific content.\n\n2. Integration with Internet Access and DALL-E: The model's capabilities are expanded by integrating internet access and DALL-E, enabling it to generate images from text. This integration exemplifies the potential of GPTs when combined with other technologies, enhancing their overall functionality.\n\n3. Educational Tool for Screenplay Writing: Designed as an educational tool, OpenStorytelling Plus goes beyond mere novelty. It offers practical assistance and learning opportunities in screenplay writing, allowing users to ask questions and receive informed responses.\n\n4. Innovative Application of GPTs: This tool showcases how GPT technology can be creatively adapted and integrated with other systems to create a unique, functional system, contributing to the dynamic evolution of the GPT field.\n\nAdditionally, the absence of specific prompts in OpenStorytelling Plus implies a more autonomous and user-driven approach:\n\n1. Autonomous Learning from Text Files: The GPT model learns from the provided text files, using them as a knowledge base to inform its responses, thus enabling a more organic interaction.\n\n2. Less Directive Interaction: Without predefined prompts, the model responds to user queries based on its accumulated knowledge, allowing for a broad range of questions and topics.\n\n3. Potential for Generalized Responses: The model may offer more generalized responses, which can be advantageous in an educational setting, catering to a wide array of inquiries.\n\n4. User-Driven Interaction: This approach empowers users to guide the interaction, exploring their specific interests and questions in screenplay writing.\n\n5. Flexibility and Adaptability: The GPT model in OpenStorytelling Plus demonstrates a remarkable ability to handle diverse queries and tasks in screenplay writing, showcasing its flexibility and adaptability.\n\nIn essence, OpenStorytelling Plus exemplifies the practical and innovative use of GPT technology in a specialized context, offering both educational value and creative assistance in the realm of screenplay writing.\n```",
