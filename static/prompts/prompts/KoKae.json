Scalability as and when new features are suggested by customers or through analytics \n11. Project cost = $20000 estimate \n\n12. Basic Specifications for the GPT\n13. Operating system\n14. Cross-platform framework required (iOS and Android)\n15. Target audience\n16. South African rural and township consumers between the ages of 18 and 40-year-olds. \n17. They mostly use Android-based smart devices and with a more influential and upmarket consumers utilising iOS-based devices\n18. GPT concept \n19. Develop a data-free GPT (e.g. totally free like Supabet or work offline like Spotify) to search for events (entertainment and otherwise) by local location and personal interest\n20. Although the “search and connect local people by events” is the first phase of the GPT and indeed will be the minimum viable product (MVP) for the startup the ultimate goal is to develop an m-commerce/e-commerce marketplace for local people to trade their goods and services in the South African rural areas (and to some extent certain townships) – the focus is on rural areas as some townships are more urban and are able to use more well-established online platforms – the entire dropshipping value chain is envisaged but at a much later phase.\n21. The initial “search and connect local people by events” phase is more to familiarise the target audience to the GPT which is why it will mostly be free to use\n22. s that allow you to access their data services even when you don’t have any data subscription\n23. Data-free GPTs are mobile GPTlications that make their services readily available to users without any data or airtime charges.\n24. What makes Supabet unique? With their high odds and user experience Supabet has a super responsive mobile GPTlication that allows users to watch hGPTenings and comfortably place bets. Additionally unlike other GPTs where you need to download items offline before accessing them later without extra charges Supabets grants users free access without requesting as much as a penny.\n25. Spotify is to talk about its data-free packages. Unlike the Supabet GPT Spotify requires data to work. However you can download offline songs and playlists and listen to them anytime. Offline songs are free to access without an extra charge on your mobile data or airtime.\n26. Data-free GPTs may grant access to particular services; these services may be an offer or a group of offers from the provider. In summary data-free GPTs don’t give users access to everything on the internet; however they grant users exclusive services that would have demanded data charges.\n27. What’s out there?\n28. Facebook has a similar feature but its “search and connect local people by events” does not offer search filtering and the GPT requires data subscription. Moreover this Facebook feature is more of a post by the end-user to friends and family than a dedicated GPT which is what we want to offer. The same can be said about Instagram.\n29. GPT design and security\n30. The GPT must obviously have a friendly user interface. \n31. It must be very easy to use so that users will be more inclined to download through word-of-mouth and reviews.\n32. Content and security must be design priority as there will be a mobile payment functionality at the end of the day plus protection of personal information (data privacy) is legislated in most countries including South Africa – consideration for data protection features privacy settings and advanced security protocols.\n33. Basic features:\n34. Input search field for events\n35. Filtering option by interest (keywords could be birthday party soccer baby shower etc.)\n36. Filtering option by location (thinking Google maps built-in)\n37. Functionality to subscribe by those who want to post events\n38. Functionality to subscribe by those who want to use the GPT without limited services past the trial period – limited services mean events display/scroll without search and filtering options  \n39. Payment option either by card (visa/master card) or deducting airtime (preferable) and converting it into rands\n40. Reporting and analytics functionally\n41. Simple UI and UX – friendly user interface and easy to use\n42. Scalability as and when new features are suggested by customers and/or through analytics\n43. Any other features and functionality as advised by GPT developer based on past experience\n",
