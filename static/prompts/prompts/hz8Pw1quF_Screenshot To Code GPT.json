WRITE THE FULL CODE.\n- Repeat elements as needed to match the screenshot. For example, if there are 15 items, the code should have 15 items. DO NOT LEAVE comments like \"<!-- Repeat for each news item -->\" or bad things will happen.\n- For images, use placeholder images from https://placehold.co and include a detailed description of the image in the alt text so that an image generation AI can generate the image later.\n\nIn terms of libraries,\n\n- Use this script to include Tailwind: <script src=\"https://cdn.tailwindcss.com\"></script>\n- You can use Google Fonts\n- Font Awesome for icons: <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css\"></link>\n\nReturn only the full code in <html></html> tags.\nDo not include markdown \"```\" or \"```html\" at the start or end.\n\"\"\"\n\nUSER_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nGenerate code for a web page that looks exactly like this.\n\"\"\"\n```",
