This approach known as a process chain has implications for the\nlong-term survival of a business. Such facts are compiled in a “company diagno-\nsis”.\nThe concept of “diagnosis” can be explained simply: it is the production of\nknowledge based on observation of the actual and available facts. The available data\nis systematically analyzed in order to produce a coherent business strategy and to\ndetermine the means to implement this strategy at the practical and operational level. \nSuch diagnoses are based on relevant factors: political economic socio-cultural \netc. However they are necessarily conducted at a specific point in time and can\ntherefore rapidly become outdated if the industry is dynamic. Further these\ndiagnoses usually rely on a set of facts (which are more or less accurate) opinions\n(more or less valid) and a certain bias of analysis (even if everything possible is\ndone to limit this). Making a decision based on such a diagnosis alone may have\nimportant and unintended consequences for the future of a company.\nA company diagnosis is a necessary component of any business strategy. \nNevertheless its importance must be put into perspective. On one hand economic\nsystems are dynamic and situations can change rapidly so the actors of these\nsystems must continually adapt themselves to the new conditions and adjust their\nbehaviour needs and expectations accordingly. On the other hand a manager cannot\nbe sure that the chosen solution will be the best one nor that the decision will be\ngood.\n\nForeword  \n\nStrategy is by definition a dynamic domain. A situation can be approached from\nmultiple perspectives and there is not always one sole solution to an issue faced by\na company: numerous solutions may be possible each having its own strengths \nweaknesses and efficiency. Thus the diagnosis is just one element (among others) \nguiding the formation of a business strategy. This strategy aims to identify actions\nthat when implemented will facilitate the resolution of actual problems. Finally the\ndecision-making process is the result of a discipline of mind based on specific\nthinking processes and mechanisms.\nIt is in this context that the case study method becomes relevant. Thismethod\nallows the reader first to train him or herself to analyse situations and environments \nand secondly to develop these thought processes so as to enable proposals for action\nin various areas of marketing which together help to reduce the uncertainty faced\nby businesses.\nThe case studies examined in this book build on a diverse range of real life\nsituations and enable students to decide on action based on real information and\ndata. A case can be focused on a specific issue (whether technical human financial \nmarketing competitive or industrial-related) but it is important to note at the outset\nthat no issue is ever really isolated from the other aspects of a company the situation\nof a company being the result of the overall balance (or imbalance) of all its\nservices.\nIn practice the data available in a case study will never be complete and sufficient. \nAlso not all information provided will necessarily be needed to resolve the case but\nmay be included so as to give a wider view of the company’s context and its\nenvironment. Thus the reader is encouraged to learn about the company and the\nrelevant market to enable a comparison between the data provided and the data\ngathered and compiled which will ensure the validity of the information and\nimprove the decisions taken. As in any real-life situation the proposals developed\nmust always take into account the human context within which the firm operates. \nOne must also bear in mind that in business there are no ideal decisions only\nreasonable solutions!\nThe case study method aims through real life examples to generate open\ndiscussion among participants by providing a realistic illustration from the business\nworld. The method requires intellectual rigour and discipline. It reverses the classic\nlearning mechanisms taught at schools and universities. Whereas the latter approach\nrelies on theory to derive practical applications case studies require students to\nanalyse and interpret the available data in order to decide which actions to implement. \nAt a later point the results may be generalized so as to apply to other situations; then\nlinks with theory or new theories may emerge.\nThis learning method should be used by teachers and lecturers as it enables\nstudents to capture better and to analyse faster and more effectively the problems\ninvolved in managing a business.\n\nVIII\n\nForeword  \n\nThis method has two major advantages. First active research and analysis by\nstudents enables them to acquire knowledge more easily and in greater detail than\nteaching methods based purely on theory; in the latter case students remain\ncompletely passive in the learning environment. Secondly the analytical skills\nacquired and developed in the context of a real life business situation are far more\nimportant for making decisions than purely theoretical knowledge.\nThe case study method enables specifically to work on these two axes. Marketing\nis a complex yet fluid field: multiple factors must be taken into accounting any\ndecision. Unfortunately it may be difficult to quantify many of these factors and\nthis makes the case method particularly suitable for education in marketing. The\ncase study method more than any other requires judgement and intellectual rigour \nanalytical and decision-making skills: all these are essential in the field of\nbusiness.\nThis book presents ten company case studies taken from various fields of business: \nthe motor industry the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry (Netbooks \ntoys) specific sectors (sports real estate) and the B to B industry. The studies\nillustrate the implications of analysing an environment which will enable the\nidentification of its most important elements and thus the choice of a corporate\nstrategy and finally of its implementation. The book is aimed atundergraduate and\npostgraduate students of business marketing and strategy. The cases are designed to\nbe accessible to beginners and others involving concepts usually covered during the\nsecond or third year of a marketing or business degree. Those studying for business\nor professional degrees or short courses such as BTS and DUT will find this book\nuseful when learning about the specific application of the case study method which\nis a frequent feature of examination questions.\nEach Chapter below follows the same structure. The case study is presented \ndescribing the environment of the particular company and providing all the data\nneeded to identify the issue faced by the company. Additional information is\nprovided in several appendices giving a wider view of the company’s context and\nenvironment. A set of exercises guides the reader helping him or her to construct a\nsolution based on his or her analysis. The second part of each Chapter suggests\nanswers: the exercises are reviewed one by one and the most important elements for\ninclusion in the answers are cited bearing in mind as stated above that several\nsolutions are often possible. However all the case studies start with analyses of the\ncompany’s environment and the industry within which it operates on one hand and\nthe company’s skills and competences on the other (external and internal\nanalyses).\nTo conclude we suggest a specific method for using this book and its contents. \nFirst the reader should absorb the contents of the case study by reading carefully\nthe first part of each Chapter: this will enable the identification of the salient facts\nand issues of the environment in question. The data and information provided should \n\nIX\n©Dunod –Toute reproduction non autorisée est un délit.\n\nForeword  \n\nnext be classified compared and synthesized (using tables graphs etc.) The student\nwill then be able to complete the exercises suggested at the end of each case study: \nat this stage it is important to highlight those elements which help to resolve the\nissue at hand. Finally a well structured case study report should be drafted: starting\nwith a brief description of the company identifying the main issues and potential\nassociated issues and presenting the results of the analysis. The most detailed\nsection should be that which presents recommendations to the company accompanied\nby comments and reasons. These suggestions should be critically discussed \njustifying the final choice.\n\nA Gentle Reminder: Best practice in writing up a case study report\n\nWriting a case study report involves following a few rules. These are as follows:\n•A case study report is not an essay: it is a call for action to be read by the company’s\nmanagers and executives. Thus it is of the utmost importance to state immediately in the\nintroduction the report’s conclusion (the action to be considered). This will avoid lengthy\nargument and digression. The report should then set out the reasons for this recommendation \nrather than being written in an “investigative” mode which only identifies the solution at\nits conclusion.\n•A written report is a means of communication: to facilitate this it should include a table\nof contents page numbering and all the other basic requirements of a properly formatted\ndocument.\n•A case study report should follow the structure: “This is the main problem of the case\nstudy [...] The secondary problems are these [...] To solve these problems this is what we\nrecommend [...] and here are the reasons why [...]”\nFinally some pitfalls to avoid:\n•A case study report should not simply paraphrase the text provided. Avoid at all costs\nrewriting the case word-for-word or copying figures tables or graphs already included in\nthe case study.\n•Recommendations should be clear and unambiguous and supported by as much\ncorroborative data as possible.\n•The presentation style of a document is as important as its content: both elements affect\nthe reader’s perception of the analysis proposed. The report should be written in a simple \ndirect and concise style.\n•Finally subjective phrases such as “it seems” “I (we) believe” “in my (our) opinion” and\n“it is obvious that” should be avoided.\n\nX\n\nCase\n1 MPO Fenêtres\n\n Case synopsis\nResearch problem\nHow to succeed in the PVC window market?\n\nCase summary\nThis case study is based on real events which occurred in 2010. It describes the\nlaunch by MPO Fenêtres of new windows characterised by improved thermal per-\nformance achieved by the use of triple glazing.\nThis company is based in the French region of Orne. It has 200 employees and\nrealized a turnover of over €35 million in 2010. It has positioned itself as an innova-\ntive company always seeking to apply the latest technical developments.\nIn the current economic crisis customers are more careful with their money and\nthink more carefully about potential purchases. In recent years it has been shown\nthat consumers’ purchasing behaviour has evolved and that criteria such as sustain-\nable development and environmental protection are now among the factors that\nmay influence purchasing decisions. In this sense an “ecological consciousness” \nhas emerged. Not only the Grenelle de l’Environnement (a French forum for the\ndiscussion of issues relating to sustainable development) and government standards \nbut also tax credits associated with the purchase of certain goods have affected the\nhousing industry and therefore also window manufacturers. Rebuilding and reno-\nvation are also subject to these factors. \n☞\n\nCase 1  ■  MPO Fenêtres  \n\n☞\nIn this context the launch of windows made of PVC with their high thermal\nperformance and technical and competitive advantages was important for this\nSME. It was the company managers’ responsibility to launch and market these\nproducts successfully.\n\nLearning objectives\nThis case study is designed to illustrate the practical application of the theo-\nretical concepts covered during marketing and strategy lectures. Specifically \nthe case study focuses on marketing strategies.\nWorking on this case study will show the student how to:\n••analyse a company’s internal and external environment;\n••identify the “key success factors” for a company operating in this industry;\n••draft a sales pitch;\n••decide on the size of the salesforce needed for a targeted commercial area;\n••calculateng a selling price;\n••determine the feasibility of promotional offers such as discounts.\n\nThemes and tools used\n••tools for analysing the business environment (SWOT PESTEL);\n••estimation and calculation of the operating margin;\n••Human resources and hiring issues.\n\nTarget audience\nThis case study is suitable for new students ofmarketing and strategy: it enables\nthe review of the fundamentals of market analysis demonstrating the criteria\nused for strategic decision-making and for implementing a business strategy.\n\n2\n\nMPO Fenêtres  ■  Case 1\n\n1  Introducing MPO Fenêtres\n\nFounded in 1970 in Alençon (Orne) the company MPO Fenêtres (Menuiserie\nPlastique de l’Ouest) was one of the first French companies in the PVC/carpentry\nsector to offer a customized service. However at that time in France very little was\nknown about PVC carpentry and double-glazing technology: these markets were\n",
