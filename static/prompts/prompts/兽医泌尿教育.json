The prevalence of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in cats with hyperthyroidism\n43. (n ¼ 90) diabetes mellitus (DM) (n ¼ 57) and chronic kidney disease (CKD)\n44. (n ¼ 77) was evaluated retrospectively. It was found to be 12% in cats with\n45. hyperthyroidism and DM respectively and 22% in cats with CKD. Associations\n46. between UTIs and clinical signs biochemical markers in serum and urinalyses\n47. were investigated. Many of the cats with UTIs had no clinical signs of lower\n48. urinary tract disease or changes in their laboratory values indicative of infection.\n49. Therefore a urinalysis alone should not be used to exclude UTIs in these cats.\n50. UTIs are relatively common in cats with hyperthyroidism DM and CKD and\n51. urine cultures are recommended as part of the basic diagnostic plan for cats\n52. suspected of suffering from these conditions.\n53.

Hyperthyroidism is a very common en-\n55. docrine disease in older cats affecting\n56. approximately 1/300 cats and has\n57. been diagnosed with increasing incidence since\n58. the 1980s (Gerber et al 1994; Edinboro et al\n59. 2004). Common thyrotoxic complications are\n60. hypertension heart failure and chronic kidney\n61. disease (CKD) (Gunn-Moore 2005). To the au-\n62. thors’ knowledge urinary tract infections (UTIs)\n63. have not been reported to be common in cats\n64. or humans with hyperthyroidism.\n65. Multiple studies have been published on hu-\n66. mans with diabetes mellitus (DM) reporting\n67. a high prevalence of bacteriuria and an increased\n68. risk for pyelonephritis (Geerlings et al 2000 2001;\n69. Ronald and Ludwig 2001; Stapleton 2002). Vari-\n70. ous publications also showed a high prevalence\n71. of UTIs in humans with CKD with asymptom-\n72. atic bacteriuria being a common finding in these\n73. patients (Saitoh et al 1985; Rai et al 2002). In one\n74. study the incidence of bacterial cystitis in 158\n75. dogs and 71 cats with DM was 12.7% in dogs\n76. *Corresponding author. Tel: þ1-607-253-4370; Fax: þ1-607-253-\n77. 3534. E-mail: rg225@cornell.edu \n78. and 9.9% in cats and females were found to\n79. have a higher prevalence of UTIs when com-\n80. pared to males (Kirsch 1998). In another study\n81. the incidence of UTIs was reported to be 24%\n82. in diabetic dogs with the infected dogs having\n83. an increased incidence of bacteria in their urine\n84. sediment and a greater percentage of females\n85. being present in the positive culture group\n86. (McGuire et al 2002). A retrospective study\n87. describing the clinico-pathological findings asso-\n88. ciated with CKD in cats showed a prevalence of\n89. bacterial UTI of 16.7% (DiBartola et al 1987).\n90. Recently Bailiff presented the preliminary\n91. results of a study assessing the prevalence of\n92. UTIs in 879 cats seen at a university teaching\n93. hospital. The overall prevalence of UTIs was\n94. 15%; cats with DM had a prevalence of 13%\n95. cats with CKD 18% and cats with miscellaneous\n96. diseases had a 16% prevalence of UTIs. Of the\n97. miscellaneous group a small subdivision of cats\n98. with hyperthyroidism had a prevalence of UTIs\n99. of 24% (Bailiff et al 2004). However many of\n100. the cats were suffering from multiple conditions\n101. making conclusions about specific diseases and\n102. their association with UTIs difficult.

Urinary tract infections in cats 125\n105. also no attempt to correlate clinico-pathological\n106. data with the occurrence of UTIs in these cats.\n107. The goals of this study were to evaluate the\n108. prevalence of UTIs in cats with three common\n109. diseases: hyperthyroidism CKD and DM and\n110. to identify associations between the clinical pre-\n111. sentation biochemical data urinalyses and urine\n112. culture results in those cats.\n113. were treated with radioactive iodine. Post iodine\n114. treatment blood work included CBC serum\n115. chemistry panel and total T4. Concurrent renal\n116. failure was ruled out to the best of the authors’\n117. ability and cats were included only if the serum\n118. chemistry obtained following radioactive iodine\n119. therapy demonstrated blood urea nitrogen and\n120. serum creatinine concentrations within the refer-\n121. ence range.\n122. Materials and methods\n123. Case selection\n124. Medical records of cats with a diagnosis of hyper-\n125. thyroidism DM and CKD presenting to Cornell\n126. University Hospital for Animals (CUHA) from\n127. January 1996 through December 2003 were\n128. reviewed. Cats were enrolled if their medical\n129. record documented a urine culture with urine\n130. collected by cystocentesis or catheterization\n131. a urinalysis and non-equivocal evidence of the\n132. primary diagnosis. At CUHA a urine culture\n133. was considered part of the basic diagnostic\n134. work-up in cats presenting with these diseases\n135. during the years of the study. Cats were excluded\n136. if there was evidence in the record of urethral\n137. catheterization or treatment with antibiotics in\n138. the month before presentation. Cats with concur-\n139. rent disorders were excluded from the hyperthy-\n140. roid group but not from the DM or CKD group if\n141. the concurrent disorder was not thought to have\n142. a major impact on the lower urinary tract. This is\n143. because the vast majority of cats with DM and\n144. some of the cats with CKD suffered from concur-\n145. rent disorders. Intact and neutered cats were not\n146. separated for data analysis.\n147. Hyperthyroid cats\n148. The diagnosis of hyperthyroidism was based on\n149. appropriate history clinical findings and labora-\n150. tory data including a complete blood count\n151. (CBC) serum chemistry panel increased (at pre-\n152. sentation or historical) total serum thyroxin con-\n153. centration (T4) (reference range: 1.5e\n154. 4.0 mg/dl\n155. 19.4e\n156. 51.6 nmol/l) or free serum thyroxin concen-\n157. tration (fT4) (reference range 1.5e\n158. 4 ng/dl\n159. 19.4e\n160. 51.6 pmol/l) and a positive thyroid scintig-\n161. raphy scan with pertechnetate. Methimazole\n162. treatment was completed at least 1 week before\n163. their presentation. Individual cases were further\n164. evaluated with electrocardiography blood pres-\n165. sure measurements thoracic radiographs abdo-\n166. minal ultrasound and echocardiogram to rule\n167. out cardiac or renal disease. All cats included\n168. Cats with DM\n169. The diagnosis of DM was also based on history\n170. clinical findings and laboratory data including\n171. a CBC serum chemistry panel and urinalysis.\n172. Hyperglycemia (>140 mg/dl 7.8 mmol/l) and\n173. glucosuria increased fructosamine concentration\n174. (>325 mmol/l) and/or treatment with insulin\n175. had to be documented in the record for inclusion.\n176. Cats with CKD\n177. The diagnosis of CKD was based on history clin-\n178. ical signs and laboratory data (CBC serum\n179. chemistry panel and urinalysis). All cats in-\n180. cluded in the study had to have increased blood\n181. urea nitrogen (>35 mg/dl 12.5 mmol/l) and cre-\n182. atinine concentrations (>2.1 mg/dl 186 mmol/l)\n183. and a low urine specific gravity (USG) (<1.030).\n184. These values had to be documented at least 4\n185. weeks prior to and again during the visit when\n186. the urine culture was obtained.\n187. Laboratory data\n188. CBCs serum chemistry panels and urinalyses\n189. were performed at Cornell University in a stan-\n190. dard fashion. USG was determined by refrac-\n191. tometer urine glucose ketones and bilirubin\n192. concentration was measured using a dipstick.\n193. Urine protein concentration was determined by\n194. the sulfosalycilic acid (SSA) method. Urine sedi-\n195. ment was examined microscopically to evaluate\n196. for the presence of white blood cells (WBCs)\n197. bacteria epithelial cells casts and crystals.\n198. Trained laboratory technicians performed urine\n199. sediment examinations. Hematuria and urine\n200. red blood cells (RBCs) were not included in\n201. this study due to urine collection by cystocente-\n202. sis. Quantitative urine cultures were performed\n203. in all cases. Reported bacterial growth was\n204. considered a UTI. Commercial plates (Sensitire\n205. veterinary urinary two isolate MIC Trek\n206. Diagnostic System) were used for standardized\n207. urine minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)\n208. testing for ampicillin amoxycillin/clavulanic\n209. acid ceftiofur cephalexin enrofloxacin tetracy-\n210. cline and trimethoprim/sulfonamide (TMS).\n211. Microscopic evidence of bacteria on evaluation\n212. of the urine sediment was considered bacteriuria\n213. and a positive urine culture was considered\n214. a UTI.\n215. Statistical analysis\n216. The prevalence of UTIs in each group and the\n217. confidence interval (CI 95%) was calculated.\n218. The c2 test was used to look for an association\n219. between clinical signs of lower urinary tract dis-\n220. ease (LUTD) and positive cultures. Fisher’s exact\n221. test was used to find associations between clini-\n222. cal signs and biochemical markers in blood tests\n223. and urinalysis and UTIs in each group sepa-\n224. rately. Fisher’s exact test was also used to look\n225. for interrelations when associated factors were\n226. found. A one-sided approach was chosen for\n227. all questions. All data were divided into two\n228. groups male and female treatment and no treat-\n229. ment physiological and pathological values in\n230. reference range or above. Intact and neutered\n231. cats were not separated for the purpose of anal-\n232. ysis. The cut off for defining low USG was cho-\n233. sen by the authors at 1.020 and for high urine\n234. pH at 7.5 because low USG and alkaline pH\n235. have been associated with a higher risk for bacte-\n236. rial growth (Lees et al 1979). A P-value of less\n237. than 0.05 was considered significant. All statisti-\n238. cal analyses were performed using commercially\n239. available software (Statistix 8; Analytical Soft-\n240. ware Tallahassee FL 32317-2185).\n241. Results\n242. Two hundred and twenty-four cats were\n243. included in the study: 90 with hyperthyroidism\n244. 57 with DM and 77 with CKD (Table 1 Figs 1e\n245. 5).\n246. urine sediment (P < 0.0001). These\n",
