All subjects\n   were screened by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) and assessed by CARS (Childhood Autism Rat-\n   ing Scale). Pre-intervention scores and post-intervention (3 and 6 months) scores were calculated for each child using CARS Social\n   Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC). Auditory integration training was performed\n   over 2 week 30 minutes twice a day.\n   Results: All subjects demonstrated improvement 3 and 6 months following the AIT. ASD subject showed 22% and 26% percentage\n   improvement in SRS scoring 3 and 6 months respectively following the AIT intervention. Those changes were attributed to statistically\n   significant changes in social awareness social cognition and social communication. Similar results were achieved with the ATEC check\n   list: ASD subject showed 19.5% and 22.5% improvement 3 and 6 months following the AIT intervention respectively. Those changes\n   are due to statistically significant (P  0.05) improvement in speech communication and sociability only.\n   Conclusions: The results of this study support the therapeutic effects of auditory integration training on social awareness social cogni-\n   tion and social communication as well as speech and communication.\n\n   Keywords: autism spectrum disorders auditory integration therapy\n\n   Autism Insights 2013:5 13–20\n\n   doi: 10.4137/AUI.S11463\n\n   This article is available from http://www.la-press.com.\n\n   © the author(s) publisher and licensee Libertas Academica Ltd.\n\n   This is an open access article published under the Creative Commons CC-BY-NC 3.0 license.\n\n   Autism Insights 2013:5  13\n\n   Al-Ayadhi et al\n\n   Introduction\n   Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) are complex neu-\n   rodevelopmental behavioral disorders with an onset\n   prior to the 36th month. ASDs are characterized by\n   impairment of social contact and communication as\n   well as restricted and repetitive interest and behaviors. \n   Other characteristics include sensory dysfunction \n   inappropriate laughing and giggling little or no eye\n   contact apparent insensitivity to pain preference to\n   be alone and many others.1 Recent epidemiologi-\n   cal studies suggested that autism might affect one in\n   150 American children. The prevalence of ASD has\n   increased dramatically over the last few years and it\n   cannot be attributed completely to improved diagnos-\n   tic techniques and increased awareness.1\n\n   Sensory processing disorder (SPD) is relatively\n   common among children with ASD ranging from\n   40% to 80% in American children.2 Sensory integra-\n   tion (SI) theory was originally developed by Ayres\n   and focused on neurological processing of sensory\n   information. In ASD the SI dysfunction manifest as\n   difficulty in regulating responses to sensations and\n   specific stimuli. Individuals with ASD may use self-\n   stimulation to compensate for limited sensory input\n   or to avoid over stimulation.3–6 This suggests poor\n   SI in the central nervous system and could explain\n   the impairments in attention and arousal.27 SI inter-\n   vention is a type of intervention designed to provide\n   controlled sensory experiences in order to elicit an\n   adaptive motor response.2 The administered sensory\n   input must be in accordance with the child’s needs \n   and is characterized by an emphasis on sensory stim-\n   ulation active participation of the client and involve-\n   ment of client-directed activities.\n   Auditory hypersensitivity is a common finding in\n   ASD. Interventions to overcome variations in audi-\n   tory sensitivity in people with ASD have been devel-\n   oped and are collectively called auditory integration\n   therapy (AIT).  Berard’s method of AIT was first\n   developed in France in 1982. Berard postulated that\n   abnormal sensitivity or insensitivity to certain fre-\n   quencies of sound waves regardless of overall hear-\n   ing ability was associated with a range of behavior\n   and learning problems and that his technique of AIT\n   would bring about a “re-education” of the hearing\n   process.89\n\n   Thus the aim of the current project is to test the\n   effectiveness of AIT in reducing ASD symptoms.\n\n   14 \n\n   Materials and Methods\n   Patients\n   All subjects participated in the study were recruited\n   from the Autism Research and Treatment Center (ART\n   Center) at King Saud University King Khalid Univer-\n   sity Hospital. Seventy two ASD subjects 2 girls and\n   70 boys (ages ranging from 3 to 17 years old) were\n   assessed for participation and enrolled in the study. \n   All children were screened and assessed by psycholo-\n   gist and pediatrician using the Diagnostic and Statisti-\n   cal Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition DSM-IV\n   and Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS). Chil-\n   dren with a history of seizure disorder were excluded\n   from the study. Written consent was obtained from the\n   parents of each subject according to the guidelines of\n   the ethical committee of King Khalid Hospital King\n   Saud University Riyadh Saudi Arabia. During the\n   study period children were not allowed to begin any\n   new therapies or stop any current therapies including\n   medications and supplements.\n   Clinical outcome measures\n   All measurement was carried out by a qualified psy-\n   chologists. Pre-intervention scores and post-inter-\n   vention (3 and 6 months) scores were calculated for\n   each child using CARS Social Responsiveness Scale\n   (SRS) and the Autism Treatment Evaluation Check-\n   list (ATEC). The SRS is a validated test of interper-\n   sonal behavior communication and stereotypical\n   traits in autism.10 It consists of five subscales: social\n   awareness social cognition social communication \n   social motivation and autistic mannerisms. The SRS\n   measures the degree of social impairments in autistic\n   children and is suitable for assessing treatment out-\n   comes. In this study a total raw score was obtained\n   and raw scores\n",
