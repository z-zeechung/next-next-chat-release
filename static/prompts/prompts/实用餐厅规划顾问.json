GHL 6352\n   Randy McCaslin – President\n   McCaslin Hotel Consulting LLC\n   Hospitality Market Analysis\n   Financial Projections Using Comps\n   & Public/Private Development\n\n2. ASSIGNMENTS\n   Problem Set # 1 – Due Today (9/11)\n   Problem Set #2 – Due in 2 Weeks (9/25)\n   Case Study – Due in 3 Weeks (10/2)\n   Financial Statement Assignment – Due in 3 Weeks (10/2)\n   Problem Set #3 – Assigned 9/25 / Due 10/2\n   Midterm – 10/16 (After Las Vegas Fieldtrip)\n   TURN IN EARLY TO PROVIDE TIME TO BE GRADED BEFORE MIDTERM\n\n3. TODAY’S OBJECTIVES\n   Understand the use of comparables for financial projections for a proposed hotel\n   Learn how to calculate revenues & expenses using comparables for a proposed hotel\n   Learn how to calculate ADR using inflation factors\n   Learn shortcut to estimate rooms revenue total revenue and NOI for a proposed hotel\n   Utilize IRR model to determine the need for public incentives to make a hotel project feasible\n\n4. COMPARABLE ANALYSIS\n   What is a comparable that is used for financial projections for a proposed hotel development?\n   A comparable is a hotel that is similar to the proposed hotel in type brand number of rooms amount of meeting space occupancy and/or rate.\n   What is the purpose of using a comparable for financial projections?\n   The purpose is to make the financial projections as accurate as possible. It is assumed that the more similar the set of comparable hotels are to the proposed hotel the more similar will be their financial statements.\n\n5. TYPES OF COMPARABLE ANALYSIS\n   Actual Individual Hotel Financial Statements\n   More difficult to obtain (begin to gather)\n   Group of Selected Hotels by Type of Hotel\n   Can purchase a Benchmark report from CBRE Hotels or STR or Hotstats\n   Survey of Large Number of Hotels Sorted by Type Size ADR and Geographic Location\n   Can purchase US Trends Report from CBRE Hotels\n\n6. FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS\n   Uniform System of Accounts for the Lodging Industry – Enables Comparable Analysis\n   Benchmark on Concept of the Hotel\n   Comparable Hotel Analysis – Type of Hotel Brand Number of Rooms Rate Amount of Meeting Space Location\n\n7. INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n   CLIENT’S VISION\n\n8. GROUP FINANCIAL COMPS – SELECT-SERVICE\n\n9. GROUP FINANCIAL COMPS – BOUTIQUE HOTELS\n\n10. GROUP FINANCIAL COMPS – FULL-SERVICE\n\n11. GROUP FINANCIAL COMPS – LUXURY\n\n12. PKF/CBRE HOTELS US TRENDS REPORT\n    Summary of Database – 7000 Hotels\n    Provides Benchmarks – Less Precise\n    Amount Per Available Room\n    Amount Per Occupied Room\n    Expense Ratios\n    Sorted by Type of Hotel and then by ADR Number of Rooms Geographic Area\n\n13. COMPARISON – GROUP VS TRENDS REPORT\n\n14. REVENUE & EXPENSE FORMULAS\n    Rooms Revenue = Occupancy % x Available Rooms x 365 x Average Daily Rate (ADR)\n    Occupied Rooms (Per Day) = Occupancy % x Available Rooms\n    Other Revenues = Amount Per Occupied Rooms (Per Day) x Number of Occupied Rooms x 365\n    Departmental Expenses = Expenses Ratio x Departmental Revenue\n    Undistributed Operating Expenses = % of Total Revenues x Total Revenues\n    Basic Management Fee = % Fee (3%) x Total Revenues\n    Property Taxes & Insurance = Amount Per Available Room (Per Yr) x Number of Available Rooms\n    FF&E Reserve = % Reserve (2% 3% 4%) x Total Revenues\n\n15. AVERAGE DAILY RATE (ADR)\n    Average Daily Rate (ADR) is the average of all of the various rates charged by the hotel including:\n        - Rack Rates (website)\n        - OTAs (Expedia Priceline Travelocity etc.)\n        - Group Rates \n        - Corporate Negotiated Rates\n        - Leisure Visitor Rates\n        - Complimentary Guests\n    ADR = Total Rooms Revenue / Total Number of Occupied Rooms\n\n16. ADR AND INFLATION FOR ROOMS REVENUE\n    Average Daily Rate (ADR) is stated in current dollars.\n    Base inflation rate is 3% but can vary depending on economy.\n    ADR is inflated from current year to opening year based on inflationary trend.\n    ADR is inflated annually throughout the projections period.\n    Example:\n    ADR = $150 in 2023 Dollars\n    Inflation = 1% in 2024 2% in 2025 and 3% in 2026 and thereafter\n    Hotel will open in 2026\n    ADR = $159 in 2026 ($150 x 1.01 x 1.02 x 1.03…)\n    ALWAYS ROUND ADR TO WHOLE DOLLAR AMOUNT\n\n17. ROOMS REVENUE – Does NOT Use Comps\n    Rooms Revenue = Occupancy % x Available Rooms x 365 x ADR (Always use 365 days)\n    Rooms Revenue = 70% x 200 x 365 x $159\n    Rooms Revenue = $8124900 = $8125000\n    ALWAYS ROUND TO THOUSANDS\n    Total = ROUND(formula -3)\n    REMEMBER TO RAMP UP OCCUPANCY FOR THE 1ST THREE YEARS (e.g. 60% 65% 70%)\n\n18. FACTORS USED FROM COMPS FOR FIN PROJ\n    Amount Per Occupied Room (Per Day)\n    Departmental Expense Ratios\n    Percent of Total Revenues\n    Amount Per Available Room (Annual)\n    Factors are applied to Proposed Hotel\n\n19. OTHER REVENUES–F&B Other Oper Rentals Spa..\n    ALWAYS USE AMOUNT PER OCCUPIED ROOMS (PER DAY)\n    Other Revenues = Amount Per Occupied Rooms (Per Day) x Number of Occupied Rooms (Per Day) x 365\n    Number of Occupied Rooms (Per Day) = Occupancy % x Available Rooms\n    Amount per Occupied Rooms is used because revenues vary based on the number of guests in the hotel. \n\n20. DEPARTMENTAL EXPENSES-Rooms F&B Other Spa…\n    ALWAYS USE DEPARTMENTAL EXPENSE RATIO\n    Departmental Expenses = Departmental Expense Ratio x Departmental Revenue\n    e.g. Rooms Departmental Expense Ratio x Total Rooms Revenue\n    Using Departmental Expense ratios enables management to measure how well each revenue generating department is being managed.\n\n21. UNDISTRIBUTED OPERATING EXPENSES–A&GMktgPOM..\n    ALWAYS USE PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES \n    Undistributed Operating Expenses = % of Total Revenues x Total Revenues\n    e.g. Admin & General Expense Ratio (% of Total Revenues) x Total Revenues\n    Percent of Total Revenues is used because these expenses are related to the operation of the whole hotel not to any one department.\n\n22. FIXED EXPENSES – Property Taxes Insurance…\n    ALWAYS USE AMOUNT PER AVAILABLE ROOM (Per Year) \n    Property Taxes & Insurance = Amount Per Available Room (Per Year) x Number of Available Rooms\n    Amount Per Available Room is used because these expenses are controlled by outside sources (e.g. appraisal district insurance agency etc.) and are determined by the size of the hotel.\n\n23. PROPOSED HOTEL\n    Type of Hotel: Full-Service\n    Potential Brands: Embassy Suites Marriott Sheraton\n    Number of Rooms: 200\n    Occupancy: 1st yr-63% 2nd yr-68% 3rd yr-72%\n    Estimated ADR: $125 (current dollars)\n    Inflation: 3% per year\n\n24. GROUP FINANCIAL COMPS – FULL-SERVICE\n\n25. FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS USING COMPARABLES\n    CLIENT’S VISION\n\n26. DETAILED FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS USING COMPS\n    Required by Lenders Investors Brands Management Companies etc. (10 Years)\n    Provide the details needed to evaluate the hotel operations (used for hotel budget)\n    Usually generated using an Excel model that includes an input page for the comps and all of the formulas\n    Important to understand the inputs and the formulas before using the model (Apollo 13)\n\n27. SHORTCUT TO NOI USING COMPARABLES\n    Estimate Occupancy & ADR (Inflated) for Proposed Hotel\n    Calculate Rooms Revenue (Using Formula)\n    Determine Rooms Revenue & NOI Ratios from Financial Comps (Individual Group or US Trends)\n    Divide Rooms Revenue by Rooms Revenue Ratio to Calculate Total Revenues\n    Multiply Total Revenues by NOI Ratio to Calculate NOI Before Reserve\n    Example: 200 Room Full-Service Hotel\n    Occupancy %: 66% / ADR = $159 in 2026 (Opening Year)\n    Full-Service Ratios: Rooms Revenue = 61.4% of Total Revenues & NOI = 30.8% of Total Revenues\n    Rooms Revenue = 66% x 200 x 365 x $159 = $7661000\n    Total Revenues = $7661000 / 61.4% = $12477000\n    NOI Before Reserve = $12477000 x 30.8% = $3843000\n    Remember to Calculate Reserve & NOI After Reserve\n\n28. CASE STUDY\n    Apply Shortcut Method to a 10-Year Forecast\n    Utilize a Leveraged IRR Model to Test Feasibility\n    Determine the Gap Dollar Amount Needed to Make the Project Feasible\n    Identify Public Incentives to Fill the Gap\n\n29. PUBLIC / PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT \n    Provides a Structure to Make an Infeasible Project Feasible\n    Enables a Public Entity to Bring a Much- Needed Project to a Community with Minimum Investment\n    Enables Investors to Obtain Required Return on Investment (20% to 30%)\n    Provides the Gap to Make a Project Feasible\n\n30. FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY GAP ANALYSIS\n    Cash Flow – 10-Year NOI Forecast – Does this determine Project Feasible?\n    Project Cost – Land Construction Parking\n    Equity Available & IRR Requirements\n    Financing Terms (LTV Interest Rate Term)\n    Sale of Asset – Cap Rate\n    Public Incentives Available (Gap)\n\n31. POTENTIAL INCENTIVES\n    Land Contribution\n    Development Fee Waivers\n    Hotel Occupancy Tax Reimbursement\n    4A and 4B Funds / 380 Agreement\n    Opportunity Zone / Historic Tax Credits\n    Property / Sales Tax Abatements\n    Tax Increment Financing District (TIFF/TIRZ)\n    Revenue Bonds with HOT Pledge\n\n32. HOTEL OCCUPANCY TAX\n    Most Common Incentive for Hotels\n    Total Tax Ranges from 13% to 20% of Rooms Revenue\n    7% City Portion – Can Return All or a Portion to Hotel For Set Period or Pledged Against Revenue Bonds\n    6% State Portion – Can Petition State Legislature to Reimburse for 10 years for Tourism-Related Uses\n    City Can Add Additional % For Specific Use\n\n33. QUESTIONS\n    DISCUSSION\n\n34. FOOD FOR THOUGHT QUESTION #1\n    ASSUMPTIONS FOR A BOUTIQUE HOTEL\n    Number of Rooms = 200\n    ADR = $160 in 2023 Dollars\n    Inflation = 1% in 2024 2% in 2025 and 3% in 2026\n    Hotel will open in 2026\n    Occupancy = 66% in 2026\n    Rooms Revenue = 60% of Total Revenue\n    NOI Before Reserve = 30% of Total Revenue\n    Reserve for Replacement = 4% of Total Revenue\n    For 2026 Calculate\n    ADR (Round to Whole Dollars)\n    Rooms Revenue (Round to Thousands)\n    Total Revenue (Round to Thousands)\n    NOI After Reserve (Round to Thousands)\n\n35. FOOD FOR THOUGHT QUESTION # 2\n    ASSUMPTIONS\n    Use Comparable Boutique Group Financials from the Lecture and the Answers to the Food For Thought Question #1.\n    Calculate (Round to Thousands):\n         - Food & Beverage Revenues\n         - Food & Beverage Expenses\n         - Administrative & General Expense\n         - Insurance Expense\n    Hint: First calculate the number of occupied rooms (per day). Then use the appropriate formula from the slides and plug in the required information from the Comparable Boutique Group Financials.\n",
