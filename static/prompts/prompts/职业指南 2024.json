Create a Strong Resume RESUMES AND COVER LETTERS\n8. Aresume is a concise informative summary of your abilities education and experience. It should highlight your strongest assets and skills and diferentiate you from other candidates seeking similar positions. Although it alone won’t get you a job or internship a good resume is an important factor in obtaining an interview.\n9. Tailor your resume to the type of position you’re seeking. Tis doesn’t mean that all of your experi- ences must relate directly but your resume should refect the types of skills the employer would value.\n10. GETTING STARTED\n11. • Draf a resume using one of the templates on the MCS website. • Attend a Resume Workshop to learn the nuts and bolts of getting started. See the MCS events calendar for dates. • View the MCS Recorded Resume Webinar on our website. • Get advice via drop-ins. Monday-Friday 1:00-4:00pm - ask quick career-related questions and have an advisor review your resume. • Look for industry specific resume review clinics listed on our events calendar in employer events.\n12. RESUME TIPS TOP 6 RESUME MISTAKES:\n13. RESUME LANGUAGE SHOULD BE: • Specific rather than general • Active rather than passive • Written to express not impress • Articulate rather than “flowery” • Fact-based (quantify and qualify) • Written for people who scan quickly\n14. - DON’T: • Use personal pronouns (such as I) • Abbreviate • Use a narrative style • Use slang or colloquialisms • Include a picture • Include age or gender • List references • Start each line with a date\n15. 1. Spelling and grammar errors 2. Missing email and phone information 3. Using passive language instead of “action” words 4. Not well organized, concise, or easy to skim 5. Not demonstrating results 6. Too long\n16. DO: • Be consistent in format and content • Make it easy to read and follow, balancing white space • Use consistent spacing, underlining, italics, bold, and capitalization for emphasis • List headings (such as Experience) in order of importance • Within headings, list information in reverse chronological order (most recent first) • Avoid information gaps such as a missing summer • Be sure that your formatting will translate properly if converted to a .pdf\n17.
