This is the first part of a 3-part series on cinematic prompts.\n    Here’s what we’ll cover in this post:\n    ● Anatomy of AI prompts for film stills\n    ● Referencing cinematic style by era\n    ● Referencing cinematic style by genre\n    ● Referencing cinematic style by combinations of styles\n    ● (Indirect) referencing of directors and cinematographers\n\n65. Anatomy of a cinematographic image prompt\n    Cinematographic style refers to the visual techniques used by a cinematographer or director to create a particular look or aesthetic in a film. This includes visual elements such as camera angle lens choice lighting color grading and composition.\n\n66. Film Stills\n    As is so often the case when creating images using AI there is more than one way to do this. In this post we will focus on Midjourney and a basic prompt that helps us to explore how we can control certain aspects of rendering in a cinematographic style. Since words at the beginning of a Midjourney prompt seem to have more “weight” than those at the end I usually start a cinematographic prompt with the prefix “film still”. The anatomy is like this:\n\n67. /imagine prompt: film still [scene description] [style description]\n    — ar 3:2 [options]\n    (note: the “ — ar 3:2” part sets the aspect ratio to a more cinematographic one unfortunately Midjourney version 4 does not yet allow the use of 16:9 or 21:1)\n    The prefix “film still” instructs Midjourney to work towards a cinematic image composition right from the beginning without the need to explicitly describe camera angles how people are arranged in the frame depth of field lighting etc.\n\n68. Of course you could also drop the “film still” prefix altogether and still create great film footage — in fact it would give you more freedom in terms of scene composition — but you would also have to add explicitly in which way you want Midjourney to establish a cinematic look.\n\n69. A third option I see quite often is “footage from XY” e.g. “footage from a 1973 science fiction film”. This can yield amazing results if you know exactly what you want in terms of cinematic elements (lighting type of shot staging etc.) but with a strong prompt prefix like this at the beginning you also limit the possible deviations from it that you want to achieve later when you start adding things (we’ll get to that later in this post and in parts 2 and 3).\n\n70. So let’s have a look at these basic ways of starting a cinematographic rendering with Midjourney (in all the following prompts we keep the seed value the same to be able to compare our results; you can read more about the seed command here)\n    First without any film-related prefix:\n    domestic scene — ar 3:2 — seed 1000\n\n71. Next with “film scene” which basically just changes the composition and gives it a more photorealistic look (btw. something you can always add to any prompt with a quick reference like “8k photorealistic”)\n    film scene domestic scene — ar 3\n",
