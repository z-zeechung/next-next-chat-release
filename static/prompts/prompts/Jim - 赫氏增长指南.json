We provide you with background that explains the whys behind the Rules and their importance. The Rules have been established to protect the business of all Distributors the customers the brand and the Herbalife Nutrition Business model.\n\n   The rules are based on six key principles that you will learn about.\n\n   1 Complying with Business Industry and Legal Requirements\n   Requirements within the rules include protections that align with Direct-Selling industry standards and elements of the law to help keep Distributors compliant. The Rules around making claims and the way you share your story relate to this principle.\n\n   2 Maintaining Your Independence as a Business Owner\n   The Rules of Conduct respect and reflect the independent nature the direct-selling opportunity provides. As a self-employed independent business owner you have the freedom to choose how you wish to pursue the business including the amount of time you wish to commit and the amount of expenses you feel reasonable to incur.\n\n   3 Providing Distributor and Customer Protections\n   Herbalife Nutrition is a leader in the Direct-Selling industry and is proud to offer what we believe to be the Gold Standard in consumer protection for Distributors. Our Gold Standard Guarantees include low start-up costs and no required minimum purchases sales aids or business tools. Herbalife Nutrition provides clear and accurate information about potential income to prospective Distributors.\n   - The way you operate your business can impact Herbalife Nutrition the industry and your own reputation\n   - Offering a 30-day money-back guarantee on product purchases provides a positive customer experience which supports this principle.\n\n   4 Following Sound Business Practices\n   Standards that are key to building a business on a solid foundation are incorporated in the Rules. Staying informed of new policies providing basic training and regularly maintaining business records are examples of sound business practices.\n\n   For more information visit MyHerbalife.com http://hrbl.me/WYNTK-USEN\n\n   5 Protecting the Lines of Sponsorship\n   The Direct-Selling business model is about personal relationships. It takes hard work for Distributors to recruit motivate train and mentor those they sponsor and to develop and maintain a strong and sustainable organization. The Rules encourage and support\n",
