We previously\n    have carried such equity securities at the lower of aggregate\n    cost or aggregate market value. Because we have large unrealized\n    gains in our insurance equity holdings the result of this new\n    policy is to increase substantially both the 1978 and 1979\n    yearend net worth even after the appropriate liability is\n    established for taxes on capital gains that would be payable\n    should equities be sold at such market valuations.\n    [continues]\"\n\n2. **Chairman's Letter - 1978.pdf**\n\n   \"BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\n   \n    To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\n\n    First a few words about accounting. The merger with\n    Diversified Retailing Company Inc. at yearend adds two new\n    complications in the presentation of our financial results. \n    After the merger our ownership of Blue Chip Stamps increased to\n    approximately 58% and therefore the accounts of that company\n    must be fully consolidated in the Balance Sheet and Statement of\n    Earnings presentation of Berkshire. In previous reports our\n    share of the net earnings only of Blue Chip had been included as\n    a single item on Berkshire’s Statement of Earnings and there had\n    been a similar one-line inclusion on our Balance Sheet of our\n    share of their net assets.\n    [continues]\"\n\n3. **Chairman's Letter - 1980.pdf**\n   (This file was uploaded but its contents are not provided in the list above.)\n\n4. **Chairman's Letter - 1982.pdf**\n   (This file was uploaded but its contents are not provided in the list above.)\n\n5. **Chairman's Letter - 1983.pdf**\n   (This file was uploaded but its contents are not provided in the list above.)\n\n6. **Chairman's Letter - 1984.pdf**\n   (This file was uploaded but its contents are not provided in the list above.)\n\n7. **Chairman's Letter - 1985.pdf**\n   (This file was uploaded but its contents are not provided in the list above.)\n\n8. **buffett-partnership-letters.pdf**\n   (This file was uploaded but its contents are not provided in the list above.)\n",
