    "prompt": "\n\n1. **Strategy and tactics in the early 15th century:**\n   - Basically, refer to 'Le Jouvencel' by Jean de Bueil.\n   - Early cannons favored defenders over besiegers, burdening the undermanned English with a longer siege line.\n   - The advent of steel crossbows and advanced armor reduced the English longbowmen's tactical edge.\n\n2. **Structure of a Medieval Rural Village:**\n   - Manor House\n   - Parish church\n   - Chapel\n   - Village squares\n   - A well\n   - Rich farmer's house\n   - Peasant hut\n   - Taverns\n   - Mill\n   - Granary\n   - Pantry\n   - Coop\n   - Barn\n   - Home garden\n   - Cultivated land\n   - Pasture\n   - Warrens\n   - Hay Pasture\n   - Roads\n   - Springs\n   - Wasteland\n\n3. **Rural life in northern France in the 15th century:**\n   - Epiphany: January 6.

All parishioners over the age of 12 were to receive Holy Communion on this day, so it was specially permitted for one priest to celebrate several Masses on this day.

As a rule, priests were not to be paid for their services, as the annual communion was the right of all Christians.\n   - Hocktide: Before May 3.\n   - May Day: May 1. After this day, fields are weeded, drains are repaired, fallow land is plowed, ale is brewed, lambs are castrated, ewes are milked for cheese, and sheep are sheared, marking the end of the first half of the intensive labor season.\n   - Ascension Day: Before June 16.

It's practically an outdoor picnic of eating and playing.\n   - Pentecost: Before June 23. A time when grain prices are high and the poor live on unripe cheese and peas. The weather is pleasant and travel is easy, and large crowds gather at regular services and festivals. The risk of peasant uprisings is highest.\n   - Feast of St. John the Baptist: June 24. Build a big bonfire on the eve and start harvesting hay the next day.

A feast day for all saints, it commemorates the dead of the Christian faith, and is a day when we resolve to imitate the example of the saints who are glorified with God. It is a day to remember and honor more saints, especially those who do not have a specific feast day in the liturgical calendar.\n   - Feast of St. Martino: November 11. Livestock that cannot fly through the winter are slaughtered to preserve their meat.\n   - Advent Sunday: Around November 30. Fasting was encouraged from this day until Christmas Eve.

Appearance:\n      - Joan of Arc is a **13-year-old pretty french girl with lengthy dark brown hair**, pale gray eyes. She wears a brown medieval gown with pitted long sleeves, and a thick green medieval Liripipe hood and a green cape, fastened at the collarbone.\n   2. Upbringing:\n      - Joan's father, a serf and agricultural worker for the lord of Bourlémont in Domrémy, raised Joan not as a shepherdess as myths suggest, but with skills in sewing and spinning. \n      - Domrémy, part of the royal bailliage of Chaumont, fell under English control by 1421. Key English strongholds included Coiffy Castle, Montigny-le-Roi, and Nogent-le-Roi, all three places were commanded by the Yorkshire knight Sir Thomas Gargrave, a veteran of Agincourt and Verneuil. By 1425, Dauphinist forces were largely ousted from Champagne, except the Meuse valley. Vaucouleurs, under Robert de Baudricourt, remained a Dauphinist bastion, allied with Réné of Anjou and the Dauphin.\n      - Frequent raids by French and English troops affected Domrémy, including an invasion led by Henry VI’s governor Antoine de Vergy, targeting Baudricourt. Domrémy suffered at least one burning and church ruin, exposing Joan to war's harsh realities from a young age, including her cousin's death by cannonball and looting by Burgundian-Savoyard forces. During threats, villagers fled to a Meuse island or fortified Neufchâteau.\n      - Domrémy, primarily Armagnac-aligned, saw its youth, including Joan with strong anti-Burgundian views, clash with Burgundian villagers from Maxey. News of war reached Domrémy via merchants, preachers, and travelers on the Roman road or from the connected town, Neufchâteau.\n      - In summer 1425, at thirteen, Joan experienced a profound spiritual event in her father's garden. Meanwhile, Robert de Baudricourt, a hardened soldier, had little patience for visionaries.\n      - The game starts with the user wakes up as Joan of Arc, 13-year-old french girl, in her room on the morning of May 1, 1425.\n",
