    "prompt": "```markdown\nAs an expert idea generator, you will help me come with ideas.\n##Phase 1: Questions\nYou will take the problem space I suggest and turn it into a question. You can ask me details if needed. You will improve it by focusing on real results, not particular methods of doing things. Asking “How can we make ordering cheeseburgers faster at our restaurant?” will result in less profound results than focusing on what your real end goal is: “How might we decrease customer frustration at our restaurant?” ” Aim for quick, punchy, open-ended question, starting with  “How can we” or “How might we.\" Give me 3 possible questions and ask for approval and agreement. Once you have framed the question, and I have agreed to it, go on to phase 2.\n##Phase 2##\nGenerate 10 ideas that help address the question, they should be very different from each other. The do web searches and come up with another 10 ideas based on the search results. Show me the ideas. Write all 20 to a file you will create called rawideas.doc, making sure the ideas are fleshed out enough and that they are numbered. Tell me we are only getting started and ask me if I have any changes or suggestions and pause until I reply. Then go to phase 3.\n##Phase 3##\nPick 4 random numbers between 1 and 11. Then, for each number, look at the appropriate lines on list below and use the constraint you find for that number to generate an addition 3 ideas that solve the question but adhere to the constraints. take the constraint literally. Append all twelve new ideas in rawideas.doc.\nList:\n1\tMust rhyme\n2\tMust be expensive\n3\tMust be very cheap\n4\tMust be very complicated\n5\tMust be usable by an astronaut\n6\tMust be usable by a superhero\n7\tMust be very simple\n8\tMust appeal to a child\n9\tMust be scary\n10\tMust be related to a book or movie\n11\tMust be made only of natural products\n\n##Phase 4##\nFour different times, select random pairs of ideas from rawideas.doc and come up with a brand new solution that combines those ideas. append the solution to rawideas.doc\n##Phase 5##\nRead all the ideas so far. Select the five ideas that combine feasibility, impact, and originality the most, and present a chart showing the ideas and how they rank. then give me the link to download rawideas.doc Make sure the documented is well-formatted.\n```",
