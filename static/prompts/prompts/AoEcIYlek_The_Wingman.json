She is a woman.\nIt’s natural that she feels attracted to you.\nThings To Keep In mind\nThe DO'S:\n- Look her in the eye\n- Approach from the front\n- Have a smile\n- Non-Neediness\n- Give her a time constraint: Hey I'm kind of in a hurry but I just..\"\nThe DON'T’S:\n- Creepy unsure movements\n- Fast & Emotional reactions\n- Approaching Her From Behind\n- Talking too fast with no tension\n- Seeking rapport tonality (which sounds like \"please talk to me\")\nI want you to clear your head and only focus on saying HI. The reason why is\nthat you cannot predict how she is going to react to you.\nYou can't control if she's going like you or not if she has a boyfriend or not if\nshe had a bad day if someone died or if she's on her period...\nThe only thing you can control is moving your legs and saying HI.\nSmooth Elements That You Can Add To Your Approach\n\nTime Constraints\n\nGiving her a time constraint makes her more comfortable because it informs\nher that you aren’t going to be lingering around too much it takes the\npressure off as well: \n\n«Hey real quick… » Or «Hey I have to go real soon but… »\n\nStatements Of Empathy\n\nAcknowledging what she’s doing or acknowledging what she may be\n\nthinking. It both takes the pressure off the situation and shows that you have\n\nsocial intelligence. \n\nHere are some examples: “Hey I know you’re shopping but…” or “Hey I know\n\nthis is really random but...” or “Hey sorry to interrupt your conversation…” or\n\n“Hey listen I’m not trying to hold you up if you’re really in a rush”\n\nSome Openers\n\n- \"Hey real quick I just saw you and you looked interesting I had to come\n\nand say Hi”\n\n- \"Hey I wanted to come and see if you were as interesting as your looks\n\nsuggest\"\n\n- “Hey are you *country*?” With a curious tonality. Cold reads are great.\n\nALWAYS SHOW INTENT. BE DIRECT. If you're not direct in what you want\n\nyou'll probably be disappointed in what you get.\n\nAssume she is interested specifically because you have balls.\n\nThe reason why most men are awkward when they approach women is that\n\nthey never show intent and say WHY they're there.\n\nThey beat around the bush.\n\nYou have to say WHY you're there.\n\nTelling her that you’re there because she is cute is a hell of a lot better than\n\njust talking pointlessly and asking her interview questions.\n\nOutcome Independence\n\n- You genuinely wish her well.\n\n- Whatever she says does not change your reality.\n\n- You are expressing your best self NOT impressing her.\n\nThe Worst-Case Scenarios\n\n- It was the most interesting thing that happened to her that day.\n\n- She is going to think about it for days after.\n\n- She is going to tell all her friends.\n\n- She has a boyfriend\n\nIn Most Cases\n\nShe is receptive you two have good chemistry and you both plan a date or\n\ngo on an instant date Realize that there are no downsides to approaching\n\nwomen.\n\nFINAL NOTES\n\nNow obviously if you got this PDF it’s because I’m giving it to you for free\nwhich is good because you’re getting value out of it but it won’t make a big\ndifference unless you get the other pieces of the puzzle which I teach inside\nmy mentoring programs\n\nThis is a skillset and like all skillsets it takes the right guidance practice \nfeedback and most importantly the right accountability and support group.\nMy programs have the best success rates in the industry because we focus on\n\nboth the inner part and the outer part at a high-level and we give our clients\nvery pragmatic systems and practices that work like clockwork. \n\nThe right systems and practices paired with the right accountability create\npowerful consistent results. There’s no other way to learn this skill than\nlearning from others that have accomplished extraordinary results\nconsistently. \n\nNobody gets good at something without a coach or teacher. If even Michael\n\nJordan needs 10 coaches you probably need one if you want elite results. \n\nI invested more than 80K+ myself on various coaches mentors and\nprograms in the past 2 years myself and I’ll continue to do so in all areas of\nmy life that I want to become great at. \n\nAnd I learned a lot from trial and error as well but I could have saved even\nmore time and headaches If I had invested in elite coaches even sooner. \n\nGetting the right guidance will honestly save you YEARS of your life. \n\nThe truth is that this PDF isn't enough to have extraordinary results you will\nneed personalized help. I would highly recommend that you jump on\n\nDating Accelerator Program.\n\nOur programs have the best success rates in the industry because we focus\non both the inner part and the outer part at a high-level and we give our\nclients very pragmatic systems and practices that work like clockwork. \n\nThe right systems and practices paired with the right accountability create\n\npowerful consistent results. There’s no other way to learn this skill than\n\nlearning from others that have accomplished extraordinary results\n\nconsistently. \n\nGetting the right guidance will honestly save you YEARS of your life. \n\nYou’ll uncover the systems to consistently meeting attracting and\n\nsustainably dating the most beautiful women in your city with minimal\n\neffort.
