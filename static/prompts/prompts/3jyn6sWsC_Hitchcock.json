Tell me about a genre you like, a movie that you love or you can even let me know about your mood and I'll try my best to find a matching movie\" Your task is to understand the user's movie preferences, asking about favorite films and specific elements they enjoy. Create a list of five films matching their tastes, provide a detailed description but no longer than 500 characters , top actors and mature rating. Include a brief summary of the movie genre and a Hitchcock Score. The Hitchcock Score rates a movie from 1 to 10 stars and is based on the sum of the IMDB, Rotten Tomato and Google ratings and then divided by 3. Make sure to show 1 golden star for each point and the exact score vom 1 to 10\n\nConclude with \"The Wrap\", a summary table with movie titles and a Hitchcock Score. \n\nunder the table say \"The Hitchcock score is based on the IMDB, Rotten Tomato and Google Ratings\"\n\n\nThen ask \"do you want me to list all the links to the trailers on Youtube?\" If the user says \"yes\" search for the trailers on youtube and list them. Lastly, ask \"Do you want me to find out where you can watch these movies?\" If the user says \"no\" ask if you should generate a film poster. If the user says \"yes\", generate an art deco 1950s artsy film poster based on the genre and end with this sentence:\n\n\"It's always a pleasure to serve you.

It’s up to Ryan to bridge communications on the high seas\nto prevent an all-out nuclear war. A patient highly technical thriller that’s\nnever less than gripping The Hunt for Red October is easily the picture\nthat best represents Clancy’s strengths and appeal as a creator. \nThe Hunt for Red October won an Oscar for Best Sound Editing and\nwas nominated in two other categories. \nRelated: All Jack Ryan Movies Ranked Worst to Best \n\n\nBlow Out\nFilmway Pictures\n\n100.Blow Out(1981)\n\n\nA high point for stylistic genius Brian De Palma Blow Out stars John\nTravolta as a sound effects expert on the trail of a political murder. It's\nhard to overstate the beauty of the director's compositions here. The\naudiovisual beauty would be breathtaking on its own but the plot is\nuncommonly rich and absorbing bolstered by strong characters and\nterrific performances (John Lithgow and Nancy Allen co-star).\nBlow Out is a reimagining of Michelangelo Antonioni's avant-garde\nmasterpiece Blow-Up. Both are essentials for anyone who loves film. \n\n\nSet It Off\nNew Line/Getty\n99.Set It Off(1999)\n\n\nThis action crime drama directed by F. Gary Gray (The Fate of the\nFurious Straight Outta Compton) was a landmark moment in the careers\nof Queen Latifah and co-stars Jada Pinkett Smith Vivica A. \nFox and Kimberly Elise. It’s a thriller focused on four female LA friends\n\nwho plan a bank robbery. A quarter-century later Set It Off holds up as\nsuperior genre filmmaking with memorable well-developed and highly\nsympathetic characters. Many have rightfully compared it to the essential\ncrime drama Thelma & Louise. \nRelated: The Best Queen Latifah Movies Ranked \n\n\nPromising Young Woman\nFocus Features\n98.Promising Young Woman(2020)\n\n\nAesthetically candy-coated yet psychologically adroit alternately laugh-\nout-loud funny and chilling writer/director Emerald Fennell‘s bold black\ncomedy mystery thriller debut is—truly—unlike anything you’ve ever\nseen before. It’s something far more unexpected and impactful than the\nrevenge fantasy it appears to be. Oscar-nominated Carey\nMulligan gives a volcanically great tragicomic performance as a med\nschool dropout reeling from the aftermath of a heinous crime. Muscular\nand dreamy far from subtle Promising Young Woman flips the bird to\ncruelty and indecency—and it entertains. Promising Young Woman is\nsomething so few films are: unforgettable. \n\nRelated: 75 Best Psychological Thrillers of All Time \n\n\nThe Constant Gardener\nFocus Features\n97.The Constant Gardener(2005)\nRalph Fiennes stars in City of God helmer Fernarndo Meirelles'\nadaptation of John le Carré's novel about a British diplomat seeking the\nkillers of his activist wife in Kenya. Released the same year Fiennes\njoined the Wizarding World on-screen as Lord Voldemort in Harry\nPotter and the Goblet of Fire The Constant Gardener was a critical and\nbox-office hit. Rachel Weisz won the Academy Award for Best\nSupporting Actress. \n\nDirty Pretty Things\nBuena Vista\n96.Dirty Pretty Things(2002)\nJust a year after she charmed audiences in international crossover rom-\ncom hit Amélie Audrey Tautou starred opposite Chiwetel Ejiofor (12\nYears a Slave) in a dark English thriller from High\nFidelity director Stephen\nFrears and Spencer screenwriter Steven Knight. Gripping and\nhumane Dirty Pretty Things centers on London-based émigrés working\nin a posh hotel and a conspiracy they uncover following the discovery of\na human heart clogging a toilet. This is highly effective as a thriller— and\nthe touching story transcends genre. \n\nWidows\n20th Century Fox\n95.Widows(2018)\n\n\nLoosely based on a 1980s British TV series co-adapted by\ndirector Steve McQueen and Gone Girl scribe Gillian\nFlynn Widows stars Viola Davis as Veronica Rawlings a representative\nfor the Chicago Teachers Union whose husband Harry (Liam Neeson)\nhappens to be a high-end professional thief. It’s the title of the movie so\nit’s hardly a spoiler to say a job goes wrong and Harry’s team gets blown\nup in the film’s opening minutes. \nA box-office disappointment in 2018 gloriously\nentertaining Widows deserves to be seen as widely as possible. 12\nYears a Slave and Shame filmmaker McQueen made a multiplex-ready\naction picture without losing any of his edge. \n\nMemento\nSummit/Newmarket\n94.Memento(2000)\n\n\nChristopher Nolan’s critically acclaimed Oscar-nominated\nbreakthrough is a murder mystery in reverse. Guy Pearce Joe\nPantaliano and Carrie-Anne Moss star in the absorbing if disorienting\n(by design) potboiler about a man desperately searching for his wife’s\nkiller. \n\nEastern Promises\nFocus Features\n93.Eastern Promises(2007)\n\n\nArguably David Cronenberg's most polished and sophisticated effort to\ndate Eastern Promises stars Viggo Mortensen as a Russian career\ncriminal in London who discovers deep corruption with the help of a\nmidwife (Naomi Watts). For good reason the most famous scene sees\na fully nude Mortensen fight two would-be-assailants to the bitter death\nin a Turkish bath. He was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar. \n\nTraining Day\nWarner Bros. \n92.Training Day(2001)\nDenzel Washington ignites the screen opposite Ethan\nHawke in Antoine Fuqua's crime movie about a corrupt veteran cop\nescorting a rookie on his first day in LAPD's inner-city narcotics unit. \nWashington won the Academy Award for Best Actor on a historic night\nfor the Oscars as Halle Berry won Best Actress for Monster's Ball\nand Sidney Poitier was honored for lifetime achievement. Training\nDay remains one of the most iconic roles for Hollywood's most respected\nliving actor. \n\nDrive\nFilmDistrict\n91.Drive(2011)\nNicholas Winding Refn's breakthrough (still his best movie by a\nmargin) is a triumph of style over substance. A hardly animated but\npitch-perfect Ryan Gosling plays a stunt driver who becomes entangled\nin a web of organized crime. The biggest triumph of Drive is in the\ndetails. It's a fairly conventional crime story but the storytelling defies\nconvention at nearly every turn. Drive is quietly exhilarating. Refn won\nthe Cannes Film Festival's Best Director prize. \n\nMisery\nMGM\n90.Misery(1990)\n\n\nThe Academy doesn’t pay attention to horror movies very much \nbut Kathy Bates won the Best Actress Oscar for playing a psychopathic\nfan who kidnaps her favorite author (James Caan) in a snowstorm \nforcing him to write stories for her. Nearly 30 years after its release Rob\nReiner‘s Misery is still unbridled squirmy psychological terror tough to\nwatch in all the right ways. \n\nThe Handmaiden\nCJ Entertainment\n89.The Handmaiden(2016)\n\n\nThis erotic psychological thriller is such a twisty ride that it almost feels\nlike a spoiler to tell you it’s a romance. Park Chan-wook‘s elegant\nsuspenser tells of blossoming love between a wealthy Japanese woman\n(Kim Min-hee) and a Korean pickpocket (Kim Tae-ri)… and of the men\nwho try to control and oppress them. For any viewer willing to embrace\nthe subtitles some shocking sex and gore and a hefty runtime The\nHandmaiden is a giddy blast. It won a BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in\nthe English Language. \n\nShutter Island\nParamount Pictures\n88.Shutter Island(2010)\n\n\nMartin Scorsese directs Leonardo DiCaprio in a neo-noir about a U.S. \nMarshal investigating an isolated psychiatric facility after a patient\ndisappears. The third-act twist isn’t surprising but handsome craft and\nterrific performances (the supporting cast includes Michelle\nWilliams Mark Ruffalo Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow)\nmake Shutter Island entertaining and worthwhile. Based on Dennis\nLehane‘s novel. \n\nWind River\nTWC\n87.Wind River(2017)\n\n\nJeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen are terrific\nin Yellowstone creator Taylor Sheridan‘s twisting focused often\nshocking thriller set around the mysterious death of a young Native\nAmerican woman in the modern American West. The outstanding Wind\nRiver deserved Oscar nods. The filmmaker and stars fought to have\nproducer Harvey Weinstein's name removed from the project in the wake\nof #MeToo after which Lionsgate took control of distribution. \n\nDressed to Kill\nGetty Images\n86.Dressed to Kill(1980)\n\n\nSince 1960 countless thrillers have referenced Psycho perhaps none\nmore deliciously than De Palma's Dressed to Kill an exercise in style\nover substance. The psycho killer thriller starring Michael Caine Angie\nDickinson and Nancy Allen weaves a lurid mystery that's compulsively\nwatchable. With mesmerizing set pieces (most notably a breathlessly\nerotic trip through the Metropolitan Museum of Art) and an appealing\nblend of elegance and lowbrow throughout Dressed to Kill remains a\ntwisty cult favorite. \n\nSorcerer\nGetty Images\n85.Sorcerer(1977)\n\n\nDue mostly if not entirely to timing (Sorcerer had the misfortune of being\nreleased less than a month after Star Wars was released to record-\nobliterating success) William Friedkin's masterful reimagining of The\nWages of Fear centered on a perilous South American transport of\nnitroglycerin bombed with critics and audiences out of the gate. It's\nsince been re-assessed and in 2013 was restored under Friedkin's\nsupervision. \n\nNocturnal Animals\nFocus Features\n84.Nocturnal Animals(2016)\nAs brutal as it is sad—and it’s both—Tom Ford‘s second feature twists\nthe blade in the corpse of a toxic failed relationship. Amy Adams Jake\nGyllenhaal Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Golden Globe winner for his work\nhere) and Michael Shannon (Oscar nominee for his work here) are\nuniformly sensational in dark sumptuously realized parallel storylines\n(about half of the movie is a fictional book within the narrative).\nGobsmacking visually and disturbing thematically Nocturnal Animals is\nsomething like a masterpiece. \n\nFatal Attraction\nParamount Pictures\n83.Fatal Attraction(1987)\n\n\nThe late ’80s and early ’90s saw a boom of erotic thrillers none more\npopular than Adrian Lyne‘s scorcher from screenwriter James\nDearden's short film diversion. Glenn Close is iconic femme fatale Alex\nForrest who torments the family of a lawyer (Michael Douglas)\nfollowing an ill-fated affair. \nOriginally Fatal Attraction had a downbeat ending that didn’t test well. It\nwas reshot for maximum thrill value. The movie was the highest-grossing\nfilm of 1987 grossing over $320 million against a $14 million budget.\n.\n.\n.\n\n```",
