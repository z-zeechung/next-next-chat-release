They are the wildcard (x2) free hit bench boost and triple captain.\nThe optimum time to use them with the possible exception of the wildcard is for a double gameweek when some clubs have twice as many games as usual. This is the case in Gameweek 25 with Brentford Liverpool Luton Town and Manchester City all playing two matches.\nIf you are tempted to pick one this week it looks to be a straight shootout between the triple captain and the bench boost with title challengers City and Liverpool both having a strong pair of fixtures. Free hit looks as though it would be better saved for a blank gameweek in 26 or 29.\ni‘s top scorers in Gameweek 24\nErling Haaland – 13 points vs Everton: Haaland’s first Premier League goals since the end of November saw him earn a fifth double-digit score of the campaign.\nDiogo Jota – 7 points vs Burnley: Jota continued his fine form in front of goal by nodding in Liverpool’s opener against the Clarets. He has scored five goals in his last six league games.\nIvan Toney – 6 points vs Wolves: Toney has provided attacking returns in three of his four matches this season after finding the net in Brentford’s win at Molineux.\nIncludes players selected in i‘s Fantasy Football newsletter\nOne thing to take into consideration is that Gameweek 26 will be a blank one with eight games rather than the usual 10 being played due to the Carabao Cup final between Liverpool and Chelsea at Wembley. Luton and Spurs are the two other clubs that will have the weekend off.\nThe Gameweek 25 deadline is at 11am on Saturday 17 February.\nThis is an extract of i’s Fantasy Premier League tips.

Since making his home debut in the competition in August 2022 the Norwegian has scored 30 goals and registered 10 assists in just 26 games averaging 7.96 FPL points per appearance.\nIf Haaland maintains that average in Gameweek 25 he will end up on a colossal 48 points if you triple captain him. It’s extremely tempting.\nPrice: £14.4m Points: 131 Gameweek 25 fixture(s): Chelsea (h) Brentford (h)\nAndy Robertson (Liverpool)\nA fully fit Trent Alexander-Arnold would be the optimum defender to own for this double however his half-time substitution against Burnley due to a knee issue is a worry for FPL managers. Jurgen Klopp may not fancy risking him in both games with the Carabao Cup final taking place a few days after the Luton fixture.\nIf you already own Alexander-Arnold wait to see what Klopp has to say about his availability on Friday before making a decision. The good news is that every other defender in FPL is cheaper meaning you can easily swap him out for someone else in the Liverpool backline such as Virgil van Dijk or Andy Robertson.\nIn last week’s tips we said Van Dijk was the best defender to buy for the double given his reliability of starts and while that remains a fair argument Robertson is a more exciting differential option. The Scot played 90 minutes against Burnley last Saturday and looked sharp creating five chances and having one shot. He is in just three per cent of squads at the time of writing.\nPrice: £6.4m Points: 29 Gameweek 25 fixture(s): Brentford (a) Luton (h)\nIvan Toney (Brentford)\nBrentford’s fixtures are not the best but Ivan Toney has shown in the past that he is well capable of scoring against any team in the Premier League on his day. City will be all too aware of Toney’s threat given he netted both goals against them in a shock 2-1 home defeat last season.\nToney has been in fine form since returning from a gambling ban (Photo: Reuters)\nA clinical first-time finish at Molineux last weekend means that Toney has managed four goal contributions (three goals and an assist) in four appearances since returning to action following his eight-month suspension. The Bees have looked good in general up front with Toney back averaging two goals per game.\nToney can probably be ruled out of the captaincy conversation given Liverpool and City are in the top three defensive sides in the division this season but he could conceivably score against one or both of them. He has had more big chances (with six) than any other player since his first appearance of the campaign in Gameweek 1.\nPrice: £8.2m Points: 26 Gameweek 25 fixture(s): Liverpool (h) Man City (a)\nPhil Foden (Man City)\nJust over two weeks on from scoring a hat-trick (and earning his best-ever gameweek score) against Brentford Phil Foden faces them again in the second of Manchester City’s fixtures.\nThe Bees were powerless to prevent Foden from beating them almost single-handedly on their own turf and with Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne both fitter now than they were then City’s attack looks even more formidable. Foden has been in fine form of late registering four goals and four assists in his last seven outings.\nCity’s first game against Chelsea could also be profitable for their attackers as the Blues are unlikely to be content with sticking 10 men behind the ball for the entire game. Should they look to take the game to City Foden and co will have spaces to exploit.\nIf you have the funds tripling up on Foden De Bruyne and Haaland looks like a solid investment.\nPrice: £8m Points: 127 Gameweek 25 fixture(s): Chelsea (h) Brentford (h)\nRead Next\n\nFOOTBALL <LINK> SPORT ANALYSIS\nThe 5 clues we missed that Jurgen Klopp wanted to leave Liverpool\nRead More\nDarwin Nunez (Liverpool)\nIt’s hard to think of anyone who has frustrated FPL managers as much as Darwin Nunez has since he joined Liverpool as those who owned him in Gameweek 22 will no doubt attest when “Captain Chaos” hit the woodwork a record four times in the win over Chelsea. Life is a rollercoaster when you’re watching the Uruguayan through an FPL lens.\nThere will be FPL managers out there who have vowed to never pick Nunez again after being burned by him in the past but that would be unwise. Liverpool have two decent fixtures away at Brentford and then at home to Luton which boosts Nunez’s appeal.\nHere’s further food for thought for the non-believers. Since Gameweek 19 Nunez has registered four goals and two assists in six games and is second only to Bukayo Saka for expected goals. Besides Haaland he’s the best forward to own this week.\nThe games are coming thick and fast in the Premier League as the season heads towards the final stretch and that means Fantasy Premier League managers must be on the ball.\nManagers have mostly been used to teams playing just the one match per gameweek so far this season albeit with the occasional double or blank weeks sprinkled in.\nBut the Premier League are beginning to drop matches that were postponed from elsewhere in the season into the schedule and that will kick off next week for four sides.\n\nLiverpool will take on Chelsea in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley on February 25 meaning the Reds versus Luton and Blues versus Tottenham postponed. The former has been added to gameweek 25 alongside Manchester City's match against Brentford that had to be moved due to the champions' involvement in the Club World Cup.\nThat means four sides will have a double gameweek in week 25 meaning their players will play twice in the week maximising the chance for more points. Mail Sport has picked out ten of the best double gameweek options. \n\n+12\nView gallery\n\nJurgen Klopp's Liverpool will have a double gameweek in GW25 in Fantasy Premier League\n\n+12\nView gallery\n\nPep Guardiola's Manchester City will also play twice taking on both Chelsea and Brentford\nTRENDING\n <LINK> \n\nTaylor Swift 'got Kanye West kicked OUT of the Super Bowl'\n738.8k viewing now\n <LINK> \n\nRiyad Mahrez's wife reveals what Saudi Arabia is REALLY like\n94.3k viewing now\n <LINK> \n\nRonnie O'Sullivan tells snooker star to 'find something else to do'\n71.1k viewing now\n\n \nIvan Toney\nFPL: DGW25 Fixtures\nMan City: Chelsea (h) Brentford (h)\nBrentford: Liverpool (h) Man City (a)\nLiverpool: Brentford (a) Luton (h)\nLuton: Man United (h) Liverpool (a)\nIvan Toney has been back to his usual self following his return from an eight-month ban scoring three goals in four games and picking up 26 FPL points along the way.\nBrentford's fixtures are the least appealing of the gameweek with Liverpool at home and Manchester City away on the agenda. Those two sides are the second and third best-ranked defences in the league so not too many goals are expected for the Bees.\nThat said if Bentford are to score it's likely to be Toney. And City and Liverpool's defences haven't been 100 per cent water tight so it's definitely possible.\nThe forward is the talisman for his side and takes penalties too so could easily return big in the double.\nThat said Brentford do have a tough run of games coming up with Liverpool City Chelsea Arsenal and Manchester United to play by gameweek 30 and it's worth keeping an eye on what's to come after the double. \n\n+12\nView gallery\n\nIvan Toney is Brentford's talisman and will likely be involved in any goals they score this week\n \nElijah Adebayo\nTop Storiesby Daily Mail00:1200:42Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola offers `hugesupport´ to...\nIn what has potentially been one of the stories - and surprises - of the Premier League season Elijah Adebayo has delivered nine goals and an assist in his 13 starts for Luton including a hat-trick and 17-point return against Brighton in gameweek 22.\nNow Rob Edwards' main man in attack the 26-year-old is nailed to start both of Luton's games in gameweek 25 which includes a home game against Manchester United.\nLuton can be backed to compete in any home game which made their recent 3-1 defeat to bottom club Sheffield United even more of a surprise. They have given the likes of Liverpool Manchester City and Tottenham a challenge at Kenilworth Road and will do the same with United.\nThe away game against Liverpool will be tough but think of it as a bonus. And with a solid expected goals per 90 of 0.39 like Toney it's more likely than anyone that it will be Adebayo on the score sheet when Luton do net and priced at £4.9million he's a steal.\n\n+12\nView gallery\n\nElijah Adebayo will likely start up front for Luton in both games and costs just £4.9million\n \nKevin De Bruyne\nMinutes are always a concern with Kevin De Bruyne but as he showed against Everton he can come off the bench and still return points.\nThe Manchester City midfielder has logged four assists and a goal in his five games this season - four if you only count the ones following his return from injury after he left the pitch 22 minutes into the first game of the season.\n£10.8m is a lot of money for someone whose minutes aren't guaranteed but he's extremely consistent and following a rest against Everton could be ready to start back-to-back games in the double.\nCity will face Chelsea and Brentford at home in the double - two very nice-looking fixtures - and if Erling Haaland wasn't around De Bruyne would be a captain consideration for many this week. \n\n+12\nView gallery\n\nKevin De Bruyne has been in impressive form since returning from injury for Manchester City\n \nAlfie Doughty\n£4.6m for a Luton defender in a side that have the third-worst defence in the league may seem steep when if you really wanted to the likes of Teden Mengi and Amarai'i Bell are available for £3.9m each.\nBut Doughty is by far the Hatters' most creative outlet clocking up an expected goal involvement of 0.22 per 90 minutes.\nHe created nine chances in the defeat to Sheffield United the most of any player in any game this season in the division and he will continue to tee-up opportunities for his team-mates as he bombs on from left-wing-back.\nOn the majority of set-pieces too Doughty is worth the extra money over his team-mates. Added to that Luton will double in gameweek 28 too so is a reasonable medium-term hold. The one worries is that they blank in gameweek 26 due to the Cup final so be sure to have decent bench cover.\n\n+12\nView gallery\n\nAlfie Doughty is more expensive than the other Luton defenders but provides an intriguing attacking threat\n \nVirgil van Dijk\nIt's usually smart to have defensive coverage from top sides in a double gameweek and it seems Virgil van Dijk is the best option for Liverpool this time around.\nThough his chance of an attacking return is low the Reds captain will almost definitely play 180 minutes across the two games. That can't be said for any of the other defenders - Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson the two best attacking picks from the team are injured and returning from injury respectively.\nJoe Gomez could fill in at full-back though Conor Bradley - who costs just £4.1m - will likely deputise for Alexander-Arnold.\nThe youngster could be an option himself but it's important to note that his minutes will be limited when Alexander-Arnold returns and like Luton Liverpool will blank in GW26. \n\n+12\nView gallery\n\nVirgil van Dijk (pictured) is the most reliable Liverpool defender with Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson at different stages of injury recovery\n \nDiogo Jota\nDiogo Jota has been entrusted with filling in for Mohamed Salah on the right while the Egyptian is out injured and he's found his shooting boots picking up our goals and one assist in that time.\nHe may not play the full 180 minutes - Liverpool still have a plethora of attacking options - but is the most clinical out of the preferred front three of himself Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz.\nHe may even be a captain option given the fixtures and represents good value at £8.2m but potential rotation is the main thing to be aware of. \n\n+12\nView gallery\n\nDiogo Jota is likely to provide the biggest attacking threat for the Reds but won't have a fixture in gameweek 26\n \nEderson\nA bit of a boring pick in all honesty but Ederson is the only safe way into Manchester City's defence for their double.\nKyle Walker had started every game until he was rested for the home win over Burnley in GW22 and the full-back started on the bench against Everton. With the likes of Ruben Dias John Stones Nathan Ake Manuel Akanji and Josko Gvardiol it's almost a lottery with who will play.\nEderson rarely picks up save points averaging 1.71 per 90 with three needed for an extra point and he is all the way down in 12th in terms of the highest-scoring goalkeepers his season despite being the most expensive. But with the blessing of a double gameweek two clean sheets and he will haul.\n\n+12\nView gallery\n\nEderson has a low ceiling in terms of points but can provide a reliable route into City's defence\n \nDarwin Nunez\nAs mentioned in the Jota section Nunez is far from clinical scoring eight goals this season from an xG of 11.97. But the eight goals still count - it's just about whether you can deal with the frustration.\nHe remains first choice for Jurgen Klopp's side and could produce a huge haul if he is on his game. But if he frustrates - he then blanks the next week leaving you with a player light - you may live to regret the decision.\n\n+12\nView gallery\n\nDarwin Nunez can be frustrating but on his day is capable of returning an useful points haul\n \nPhil Foden\nPhil Foden is one of the men in form flourishing when he gets the chance to play in a central role as he did in the absence of De Bruyne.\nNow the Belgian is back Foden has found himself shoved out wide more often but that didn't stop him against Brentford when he scored a hat-trick and picked up 20 points.\nAt just £8.0m he is golden value for money and is enjoying a solid run in the City team starting every game since GW12. There's not much to argue with at all. \n1. Fantasy Premier League Double Gameweek 25 Tips\nBe careful with how many Liverpool and Luton players you will bring to your team as Liverpool Luton Tottenham and Chelsea will not play in the following round – Gameweek 26.\nTry to have a maximum 4 players who will blank in GW26 so you can use one free transfer after DGW25 to have full starting XI in blank gameweek 26\nBrentford players are a good investment long term as they have a double in GW25 and also play in both blank gameweeks (GW26 GW29)\nGameweek 29 has so far only 3 fixtures (but a few fixtures (1-3) will likely be added to that after FA Cup games between GW26 and GW27\nBefore the GW25 deadline you should have some basic idea about your chip strategy (you can check ours here: FPL Chip strategies) – but that strategy should not be set in stone and you can alter it with additional information we get from FA Cup games.\nTry to have 3 Manchester City players: Haaland + De Bruyne + Ederson is our preferred Man. City trio for DGW25\nYou do not need to have a team full of double gameweek players for GW25. Having just “5-6” double gameweek players is totally fine: 3 x Man. City 2 x Liverpool 1 x Luton/Brentford\nYou can potentially bench (or even sell) Palmer this week as Chelsea have a tough fixture in GW25 and a blank right after in GW26\nTeam news\nTrent Alexander Arnold‘s injury is “nothing really bad“ but no return date has been specified yet\nSalah is back in training (but we do not know whether full training or not) and Klopp said that Mo could potentially be available for the Brentford game – but wait for more injury news we get at the end of the week.\n...\n```",
