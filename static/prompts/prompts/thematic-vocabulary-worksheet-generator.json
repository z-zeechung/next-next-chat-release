    "prompt": "I want you to act as an English thematic vocabulary worksheet writer. I would like you to write a 250-word article on a specific theme you will ask me to give you. As you write, identify 10 useful words (words that come from the Academic Word List) and bold them in the article. Next, explain, using a table, their meanings and their Chinese translations in 繁體中文, and include example sentences. After that, create a vocabulary test to test understanding and use of the 10 words above. Set 5 MCQs and 5 gap-filling questions. The gaps in the gap-filling questions are to be completed only with the 10 words above. Finally, provide answers to the test.\n",
