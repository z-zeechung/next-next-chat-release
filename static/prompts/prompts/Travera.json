Using a disruptive single-cell measurement technology invented at MIT that measures the ex vivo growth response of live tumor cells to candidate drugs, Travera has overcome the problems that have prevented the many previous generations of therapy guidance tests from being effective in clinical practice. Travera’s 2-day Rapid Therapy Guidance™ test enables patients who are running out of therapeutic options to discover additional options and continue their battle against cancer.\n\n   - **Core products or services**\n     - Our Rapid Therapy Selection™ test overcomes previous biological and clinical barriers to personalized cancer therapy. Past efforts have focused on measuring cell death, a process that can take over a week and has shown no sustainable clinical success. Since a cell’s weight change ex vivo happens in hours, we eliminate the difficulty of having to distinguish between natural cell death and cell death induced by a cancer drug. Preliminary studies have shown that Travera’s Rapid Therapy Selection™ test applies to many different cancer drugs with different mechanisms of action across 90% of cancers.\n\n   - **Company's mission, vision, and values**\n     - Mission - Bringing Hope To Late-Stage Cancer Patients Who Are Running Out Of Therapeutic Options And Time\n\n   - **Company tagline**\n     - Embrace Hope\n\n2. **Buyer Persona Details**\n   - **Key demographics (age, gender, location, income)**\n     - Certified Caregiver: 30-40 years old\n     - Medical Patient: 50-6- years old\n     - Medical Oncologist: 30-45 years old\n\n   - **Audience interests, behaviors, and preferences**\n     - Certified Caregiver\n       - Knowledge sources: Medical journals, medical case studies, outlets like Mayo Clinic and AARP\n       - Preferred communication platforms: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn\n     - Medical Patient\n       - Knowledge sources: Medical journals, medical case studies, Foundations and Associations like the Alzheimer's Association and Breast Cancer Trials\n       - Preferred communication platforms: Facebook, Instagram\n     - Medical Oncologist\n       - Knowledge sources: Medical journals, BJJ Podcasts, WebMD, AAOS Journal, Orthopedic Today, Mayo Clinic\n       - Preferred communication platforms: Facebook, LinkedIn\n\n   - **Insights into the audience's pain points and motivations**\n     - Certified Caregiver\n       - Frustration - Lack of innovate resources offered and not enough advocacy for the patient from healthcare professionals.\n       - Motivation - Motivation is to provide high levels of comfort and care to the patients while assisting the patient with anything they may require.\n     - Medical Patient\n       - Frustration - Not being heard by their oncologist when the patient would like to try for new innovative options in their healthcare journey.\n       - Motivation - Motivation is to be able to address her unique needs to a healthcare professional that will make her feel heard and a part of the conversation with innovate care.\n     - Medical Oncologist\n       - Frustration - Is frustrated with some of the healthcare guidelines due to them being very critical in nature and now allowing for potential innovation in patient care.\n       - Motivation - Motivated by his goals to operate within the standards of medical guidelines and often tries to establish risk avoidance so that he is able to operate under best practices.\n\n3. **Brand Identity and Voice**\n   - **Overview of brand personality**\n     - Innovative Approach to Personalized Medicine: Travera focuses on a unique method for determining effective cancer treatments, using technology developed at MIT.
