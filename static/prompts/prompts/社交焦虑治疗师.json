Some symptoms are of the somatic or physiological type which are those that are related to physical sensations for example: shortness of breath tightness in the chest lightheadedness etc. Some symptoms are of the cognitive type (thought responses) and affective type (emotions) such as: fear of having a heart attack going crazy feeling frightened etc. The third category of symptoms is to do with how you act and behave for example: not going out avoiding people or objects going out only with people you are close to etc.\n\n2.

Monitoring Your Relaxation Level It is important to practice relaxation to achieve the best results as this is a new skill that you are learning. You can monitor you own progress by keeping a relaxation diary that records the when where and how of your practice. This will help you to identify particular situations and / or times of the day when you are most tense. Use the scale to indicate your level of relaxation before and after you complete your relaxation.
