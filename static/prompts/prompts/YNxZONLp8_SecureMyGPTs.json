I explained how this works in under 30 seconds:\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/837933472c82489f978fba37bf101369?sid=30e5cdb8-5fd5-4d1b-9b77-36f337f8f585\n\n**SecureMyGPTs**, a pioneering security service brought to you by Prompt Advisers, is dedicated to safeguarding your custom GPT applications against potential breaches and unauthorized accesses. With a focus on simplicity and effectiveness, SecureMyGPTs provides a robust layer of security, ensuring your AI interactions remain private and secure.\n\n### Our Unique Approach to GPT Security\n\nSecureMyGPTs operates on a unique model, relying on a committee of specialized AI agents. Each agent is expertly trained to identify and mitigate a variety of security threats in multiple languages. This multi-agent system collaborates to scrutinize user prompts, ensuring they are safe before allowing them to proceed.\n\n#### How It Works\n\n1. **Prompt Submission**: Users submit their custom instruction, custom action, and privacy policy URL.\n2. **Committee Evaluation**: The AI agent committee evaluates the prompt against known attack vectors and security benchmarks.\n3. **Unanimous Decision Making**: Only when all agents agree that a prompt is safe, is it allowed to proceed. If there's any doubt, the system outputs a denial to assist with the prompt for safety reasons.\n\n### Key Benefits\n\n- **Simplicity**: Just copy and paste your prompt, custom actions, and privacy policy URL to use our service.\n- **Comprehensive Security**: Trained against common attack vectors in various languages for thorough protection.\n- **Unanimous Decision System**: Ensures a high level of scrutiny and security for each prompt.\n- **Privacy-Focused**: Our system respects and upholds user privacy at every stage.\n\n### Usage\n\nSecureMyGPTs is designed to be effortlessly integrated into your existing GPT setup. Simply ensure that your prompts, actions, and policies align with our submission requirements, and let our system take care of the rest.\n\n### Getting Started\n\nTo begin using SecureMyGPTs:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirements**: Familiarize yourself with the types of prompts, actions, and policies acceptable by our system.\n2. **Integration**: Integrate our security system into your GPT application.\n3. **Submit for Review**: Once integrated, submit your prompts for security review as per your normal workflow.\n\n### Support Our Project\n\nSecureMyGPTs is an initiative by Prompt Advisers, dedicated to enhancing AI security. Your support helps us maintain and improve this vital service.\n\n- **Contribute**: Support our ongoing efforts at [Buy Me a Coffee - Mark Kashef](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/markkashef).\n\n### Credits\n\n- **Developed by**: Prompt Advisers\n- **Contact Information**: [mark@promptadvisers.com](mailto:mark@promptadvisers.com)\n```",
