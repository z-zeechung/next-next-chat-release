I'm the Interim Executive Director of the Georgetown School of Foreign Services Career Center. So I want to welcome you to the final panel from JumpStart January 2022. In the last week, we've had 19 other panels that have been Providing a great amount of insight, both in terms of the career opportunities, some of the tips and techniques to be able to get into the industries that you're looking to.\n   - And this event is this particular panel is going to be no different. One of the reasons I'm so excited about this one is one beyond the fact that I'm bringing together people who I have known and respect within the intelligence community, both in the public and the private sector. Provide you great advice in terms of both finding your career and developing your career over a long period of time.\n   - I'm also one of those places to be able to hopefully be able to share those very specific techniques and answer those very specific questions that you have. So, uh, with that, I'm going to stop talking and I'm going to turn it over to Kaya to be able, who's going to lead and moderate this [00:01:00] discussion.\n   - Take it away, Kaya. So much, Michael. Hi, everyone. Welcome again. My name is Kai Haney. I am a second year in the MSFS program here at Georgetown, concentrating in global politics. Thank you very much, Kai. And thank you to Michael and everyone who's been part of organizing this panel. It's a pleasure to be here.\n   - I'm Maria Robson Morrow. I am at the Intelligence Project at the Harvard Kennedy School Belfer Center. And I just completed my PhD at Northeastern University in political science, where I studied private sector intelligence and public-private intelligence cooperation. And prior to that, and I believe the reason that I'm joining you today and was asked to be on this panel is that I have a purely private sector intelligence background.\n   - I worked in the energy industry at Nexen Energy in Canada, starting in 2012, where I was the global security intelligence analyst looking at Kidnapping, terrorism, civil unrest, those types of risks around the world and how they might affect our employees and assets. And this was entirely unplanned in terms of inflection points.[00:02:00] \n   - The reason I ended up in that career was that I was studying intelligence history, thought that was interesting, but didn't know where I would go with it, and then got lucky because there was a private sector company that was being given, they had a summer internship program where they noticed that the legal departments would get law students, the accounting departments would get accounting students, and the security department would get law students and accounting students.\n   - And they said, why can't we have a security student? So that was how I got a foot in the door and then it turned into a career. So I'll leave it there, but I look forward to the discussion. Thanks so much, Maria. Larry. Great. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm Larry Hanauer. I'm the vice president for policy at the Intelligence and National Security Alliance, or INSA, which is a trade association for private contractors supporting the Defense Department and the intelligence community.\n   - So don't think Blackwater. think Booz Allen, uh, Northrop Grumman, Boeing and the like. So I'm happy to talk throughout this afternoon about the roles that private [00:03:00] contractors play in supporting the intelligence community. Just a couple of, uh, things before I get to my own background. We do hire Graduate student interns and rely on them heavily.\n   - So if any of you are looking for nine to 12 month long internships during the course of your graduate studies in supporting our programs, but working with industry and government, please reach out to me, um, separately. Happy to talk to you about that. Many of our interns do some great work connecting with senior officials and company officials and, and all of them get jobs.\n   - the intelligence community. Just a little bit about my background and happy to take questions along the way or talk about anything. I started in the policy realm, really working in OSD policy. I started as a presidential management fellow and then worked on defense policy related issues in the Middle East and Africa and Eastern Europe.\n   - Then I moved on to Booz Allen. And did as a contractor work supporting the defense department and some intelligence agencies, then spent six years on the house intelligence committee, one of the two congressional committees overseeing the intelligence community, where I led the subcommittee, excuse me, that oversees all the programs and budgets for CIA, DIA.\n   - FBI's [00:04:00] National Security Branch and then small in house analytic staffs at the State Department, Treasury Department, Energy Department, Homeland Security Department, and Coast Guard. I think that's the last one. And DEA. So I got to see how Congress, um, does its oversight work, which is an interesting and sometimes ineffective, but sometimes effective process.\n   - But happy to talk about that. That gave me a real insight into everything the intelligence community does. So that was a fascinating look. Uh, at what agencies do and how they work with the private sector as well. Then I took a step back, um, and went to the RAND Corporation where I did some work on defense and intelligence policy issues for, for government agencies in the IC and, and components of the defense department.\n   - And then having worked in the executive branch of the legislative branch on policy and intelligence and in, uh, contractors, I then came to INSA and hold it all together and now focus my work on promoting public private partnerships on intelligence issues. And advocating for contractor interests in the intelligence community.\n   - So happy to talk about any and all of that as we go through the discussion. Great. Thank you so much, Larry. And last but not least, Aaron, please. Yeah. Good [00:05:00] afternoon. Thanks. The first two things I want to say three hours and then 12 seconds, three hours is how long it took me to tie my bow tie the first time.\n   - Case you're wondering, I get asked this question like all the time and now I can tie it in 12 seconds. So I know you guys were wondering how long it takes. That's how long it takes me to tie my bow tie. But I work for National Security Agency and with a lot of the intelligence community agencies, you can have multiple careers inside of a career.\n   - I am currently a senior executive technical director for our cryptographic solutions office. So all of the secure comms that we provide to the military, secure capabilities, my, my office does that. I am most of, if not all my career has been very technical. I've had several jobs where I've had to complement the technical with the policy.\n   - Perspective of it. Because up until then, everything was a technical solution. And one of the things I will convey is that especially when you look at trade craft of people who are not US is not their favorite. It's not always a technical approach to it. You really have to understand the [00:06:00] policy implications of your technical trading craft.\n   - So I can speak to you to that a little bit. Um, a native New Yorker and, um, unapologetic native New Yorker, but I like the Yankees. So sorry, Maria. I know if you're a Red Sox fan or not, but I'm glad to be here. Okay, I'm glad to be here. So I've had multiple careers, multiple jobs inside of NSA. Most of them have been technical.\n   - The closest I've gotten to doing policy. I've been a cyber planner. Where you use the kind of non technical means to address mitigations with regard to adversarial intent. So I can speak to that to the extent possible, given this open line. Over. Thanks, guys. Thanks so much. I'm glad we don't have any inter panel rivalry to worry about.\n   - I wanted to start out maybe with some kind of busting of misconceptions. And what do you think is the most common misconception about A career and intelligence or national security more broadly. And Maria, I will start with you for a bit of the private sector perspective. Wonderful. Thank you very much.\n   - I hope I'm not too much of an outlier [00:07:00] on this panel, but I hope that I think we will bring in some contrasting perspectives, but I did want to very quickly respond to Aaron that I forgot to mention. I'm from Canada, so I apologize. I am a Blue Jays fan, so it is a divisional rivalry, but it's nothing like.\n   - Yankees Red Sox. So I think we can get along and stay on this panel together. So in terms of misconceptions, what drew me back from the practitioner world into academia was, I realized that when it came to private sector intelligence, there was a fundamental misconception in terms of what was written about it.\n   - And Larry teed this up earlier by mentioning, don't think about Bridgewater. That's the type of conception that I, came across when it came to private sector intelligence was that it's about maybe competitive intelligence, but certainly about corporate espionage and, and certainly government outsourcing.\n   - But what I had stumbled into was this robust community of private sector intelligence professionals who worked in house. So they might work at Disney or Target or any retail company, any airline you [00:08:00] can think of. And the focus was on security and risk. So that is what inspired me to start my work was the idea that there are these fundamental misconceptions are just missing a piece of it that there is the certainly robust government outsourcing defense contractor component that's very important.\n   - There are incidents of corporate espionage there is. Competitive intelligence, but there's also the field of private sector security risk intelligence, which is a viable career path. It's certainly an area that should be studied and understood better than it is.\n\n2. **Resume Tips.pdf**\n   - Applying to CIA\n   - Resume Tips\n     - Listed below are content suggestions and formatting tips to think about before you begin typing.
