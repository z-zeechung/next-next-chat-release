We called it social media.\n\nThere were burning problems in human life that led to programmers, visionaries, and businessmen building a mass solution.\n\nCommunication was local.\n\nInformation was local.\n\nBusiness was local.\n\nOpportunities were local.\n\nCenturies of geographic restriction changed in the blink of an eye.\n\nThe internet allowed for the emergence of social media.\n\nSocial media allowed for the emergence of the creator economy.\n\nThe creator economy allowed for the advancement of decentralization.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution caused an unsustainable development of dominator hierarchies – more power and less people at the top, less power with more people at the bottom.\n\nThe Age of Information began to reverse this effect with the development of creator actualization hierarchies.\n\nCreators educate, entertain, and inspire those beneath them with content and courses – but there is nothing holding any individual back from advancing to the top of the ladder.\n\nLet’s deconstruct this a bit:\n\nWhat Is The Creator Society?\n\nWith the development of the internet, information has spread beyond measure.\n\nThis led to the development of a more advanced, global, and accessible society.\n\nSocieties consist of institutions, and communities with shared beliefs, and cultural ideas.\n\nThe most notable aspects are the school system, workforce, social and business tribes, and religious establishments.\n\nSocial media has expanded and collapsed the lines between these.\n\nEverything is becoming more holistic and interconnected like rain to the ocean as the pattern of Universal division and unity hints at.\n\nThe public school system had many problems:\n\nConvergent thinking\nCompartmentalized learning\nConformity over authenticity\nMemorization over process\nFailure as something to avoid\nAuthorities as unquestionable\nLong work over efficiency and true value\nIntelligence defined by book smarts\nDecade-old curriculums that only worry about training you into a replaceable job\nThe new school system in the creator society allows individuals to:\n\nPursue their curiosity\nFind teachers (creators) that they learn best from\nTreat learning as a part of life rather than an annoying obligation\nLearn modern skills that allow you to adapt fast to the fast-changing environment\nFind specific knowledge that contributes to their pursuit of self-generated (rather than assigned) goals\nPrioritize entrepreneurship as it is the only logical end goal for those that want more out of life\nThe new school system is internet content. None of this is labeled. It is just a part of virtual life.\n\nThe religious establishments narrowed the minds of its followers and fought any perspective that contradicted their own.\n\nNow, spiritual awareness and education are accessible in most creator brands.\n\nYou can open your mind, study different perspectives, and self-experiment until you cultivate a philosophy that suits you.\n\nThis is not only for spiritual growth, but mental, financial, and health-related.\n\nWhat Is The Creator Economy?\nThe exchange of goods has been a natural part of society since the inception of human interaction.\n\nValue creation and exchange are the foundation of communication and relationships. Humans are deeply social creatures.\n\nMoney, or currency, is a neutral form of value.\n\nIndividuals spend it on what they perceive as valuable.\n\nWhat they perceive as valuable is dependent on their identity, perspective, goals, current state of mind, and level of awareness of their problems.\n\nWe can start to see the importance of marketing and sales – as they are the main skills for illustrating the value you have to offer.\n\nMarketing and sales take everything above into account.\n\nIf you don’t position a product or service to a specific person (identity) with a specific goal that implies a specific problem, you won’t make money.\n\nThe Creator Economy is composed of individuals distributing value in the form of content and products.\n\nThey educate their audience on the skills and interests that will aid in the actualization of their goals.\n\nTheir products or services are meant to generate results and move them faster toward those goals.\n\nMy One-Person Business Philosophy\nThere are almost 7B people on this planet. Someday, I hope, there will be almost 7B companies. – Naval\n\nThe best businesses change lives.\n\nAnd transformations make a winning product.\n\nStop trying to solve imaginary problems.\n\nSolve your problems.\n\nChange your own life.\n\nPackage up the method.\n\nSlap a price tag on it.\n\nYou’re less likely to fail if you solve real, meaningful problems.\n\nThis is the problem with most people entering business.\n\nThey don’t have an understanding of marketing, sales, psychology, or evolution in general.\n\nStop trying to land on Saturn or build a billion-dollar tech company when a majority of the population is suffering from low-consciousness problems (that are holding the collective ego back from enlightenment).\n\nStart as a micro education business that helps people solve the real problems in their life.\n\nThat is how you contribute to the happiness and evolution of humanity.\n\nYou do this by understanding the eternal markets: health\n```",
