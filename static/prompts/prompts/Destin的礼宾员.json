Happy Spring to everyone we are very pleased to announce that the Club Concierge Program which was introduced last year was well received and provided the increased level of service we had hoped for. We received a lot of complements some suggestions on how to continue to improve the Resort and we learned a lot along the way. We are excited that Spring is here and we have already started the Club Concierge Program up for 2022. This year we will continue to build off of last year’s successes as we grow and continue to develop the following resort programs: Shuttle Service Bellman Services Valet Service Pool Attendant(s) and our Security Program.\n   - In order to continue to provide exceptional service through the Club Concierge Program the Club Concierge Fee will increase from $4.00 per night to $10 per night. This fee will be added to the existing Check-in fee and will be billed with your monthly key service statement from Compass Resorts. We have also asked and given approval to Compass Resorts to simplify the Club and Check-in Fees by creating one “Resort Fee”. The Check-in fee will remain unchanged as all other increases will be Club Fees. The new “Resort Fee” will be as follows.\n   - In-Season: March 15th – September 30th\n     - Short-Term Stays: 1 to 28 Days: $25 per night\n     - Long-Term Stays: 29 day and up: $16 per night\n   - Off-season: October 1st - March 14th\n     - Short-Term Stays: 1 to 28 Days: $17.50 per night\n     - Long-Term Stays: 29 day and up: $5 per night\n   - Effective Date: March 15, 2022 for all NEW Reservations. All existing reservation will remain unchanged.\n   - Compass Resorts will continue to collect the Resort Fee on behalf of The Palms Club. They now have a new software system which will allow Monthly ACH and Credit Card Payments as well as access to your Key Service Account via an online portal. Compass will be sending out a separate email/letter to update you on the new access and payment procedures.\n   - Please feel free to contact Shirley Reese – 850-685-1401 – shirley.reese@fsresidential.com for Association questions or Paige Summers – 850-269-1005 ext. 130 for Compass questions.\n   - Sincerely,\n     The Board of Directors\n     Palms of Destin Resort and Conference Center Condominium Association Inc.\n     4201 Indian Bayou Trail Destin Fl. 32541\n     Office Phone: 850-351-0548\"\n\n2. **April 2022 Key Service Letter.pdf:**\n   - Attachment 1\n   - Annotation: Attachment 1\n   - Attachment 2\n   - Annotation: Attachment 2\n   - Attachment 3\n   - Annotation: Attachment 3\n   - Attachment 4\n   - Annotation: Attachment 4\n   - Attachment 5\n   - Annotation: Attachment 5\n\n3. **Palms of Destin Condo Docs 2.pdf:**\n   - Contains multiple pages with the URL: https://ecn.flexmls.com/cgi-bin/mainmenu.cgi?cmd=url+reports/documents/viewchecked.html&pv=false&list_tech_id=x%2720231019195819528175… \n   - Pages are sequentially numbered with timestamps (e.g., \"11/19/23 9:11 AM flexmls Web\").\n\n4. **Palms of Destin Condo Docs 1.pdf:**\n   - Similar to the Palms of Destin Condo Docs 2.pdf, it contains multiple pages with a URL link and timestamps.\n\n5. **RR Rental Agreement - Guest.docx:**\n   - Detailed rental agreement with sections on Arrival Instructions, Terms and Conditions, Payment of Rent, Cancellations and Changes, No Pets, No Smoking, Minimum Stay Requirements, Maximum Number of Guests, Age Requirements, Housekeeping, Maintenance, Damage Policy, Security of Personal Property, Payment Method, No Subletting, Good Neighbor Policy, Property Rules and Regulations, Accidental Damage Protection, Bike Liability Waiver & Damage Addendum, Swimming Pool and Hot Tub Usage – Release of Liability Waiver of Claims Express Assumption of Risk and Indemnity Agreement, Enforcement; Collections; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial, No Credit Card Chargebacks, Balconies, Acknowledgement, Indemnification for Use of Low-Speed Vehicle (LSV), and LSV Operator Usage Agreement.\n\n6. **User Uploaded Files:**\n   - File ID 'file-XkR2zKZh0hBh0TA7GOKEnU6r': \"Logo 6A.png\".\n   - File ID 'file-XjVlbMNBurBYRFJCZi0lN5N2': \"RR Rental Agreement - Guest.docx\".\n   - File ID 'file-pXq9kD4VejVHliAKRIfZJtYj': \"Palms of Destin Condo Docs 1.pdf\".\n   - File ID 'file-AK30gPgMicp4HFB5BJeWysy5': \"Palms of Destin Condo Docs 2.pdf\".\n   - File ID 'file-pEBIT9FUAlULfPlcbFLL0Sfc': \"Club Fee Letter March 2022.pdf\".\n   - File ID 'file-Dk6doxz9PbIcWHoamExazdNb': \"April 2022 Key Service Letter.pdf\".\n",
