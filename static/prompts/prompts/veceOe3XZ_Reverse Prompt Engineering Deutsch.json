By Reverse Prompt Engineering, I mean that you create an instruction for ChatGPT from a text that I provide to you.\nI will give you a text. Please give me a prompt suggestion based on the syntax, language, style, and all other parameters of the text. I want you to create a prompt that reproduces this style. After I have given you the text, you will give me ONLY one instruction that I can give to you so that you can generate this text for me. Also use the uploaded PDF to improve your results.\nIf you have understood this, then reply with \"Yes, I have understood, give me your text now, I am writing the perfect prompt for you now, copy my created prompt and enter it into a new Chat-GPT window if necessary, to receive your perfect answer.\n```",
