Employee recognition. \n\n   5 Dos and 6 Don’ts of employee recognition: \n\n   After business model & timing PEOPLE are the most important thing in your business. \n\n   The #1 thing that today’s top talent wants & expects? \n\n   To be SEEN & to do meaningful work. \n\n   Here are 6 Dos and 6 Don'ts when it comes to managers recognizing their team. \n\n   Don’t Rate High on Empathy? That’s OK \n\n   If you don’t naturally like to recognize others… \n\n   You can try to change but it’s likely easier to hire the right people around you. \n\n   The key is that your MANAGERS recognize understand & care for their teams deeply. \n\n   Hire for empathy. \n\n   Customize Your Recognition. \n\n   Some people appreciate recognition in a hall of 150 people whereas others want to be appreciated one-on-one. \n\n   • Don’t assume what they want \n   • Ask how they want to be recognized (in public in writing etc…)\n   • Managers align with their preferences \n\n   Managers gotta’ get personal. \n\n   Treat the individual when connecting 1:1. \n\n   Forced Moments Of Recognition\n\n   In the turbulent startup world it can be hard to prioritize recognition. \n\n   This is why I: \n\n   • Block time on my calendar for appreciation \n   • Send physical thank you cards \n   • Host monthly gratitude/recognition calls as a Co \n   • Get my team to keep me accountable or fill in for my gaps\n\n   Although not obvious pausing to celebrate your people is positive ROI. \n\n   Be Specific\n\n   When appreciating someone be specific. \n\n   Why are you recognizing them? \n\n   What specifically did they do that deserves your praise? \n\n   This does 2 things: \n\n   1. Makes them aware of what they’re doing well so they can do it again \n   2. Makes it come off as more authentic & meaningful\n\n   Bonus points if you can recognize people around company values. \n\n   Write Thank You Cards. \n\n   Thank you cards communicate effort. \n\n   It tells them that you’ve made the effort to: \n\n   • Stop your day & focus on them & their note \n   • Write a personal message inside it \n   • Post it to their address \n\n   I’ve found this is the most potent form of recognition. \n\n   And you can have your EA drive all of it (except the writing).\n\n   Recognize People At All Levels Of The Org\n\n   At times an intern deserves the same appreciation as a VP. \n\n   When recognition is institutionalized at your company the effect is compounding. \n\n   When managers ensure that everyone feels seen… \n\n   And positive impact is continuously rewarded with respect & kudos… \n\n   Proactive self-driven productivity skyrockets. \n\n   Now here are the don’ts: \n\n   Don’t Equate Recognition To Coddling \n\n   Everyone esp. the younger gen wants to be seen. \n\n   It allows them to associate greater meaning with their work. \n\n   Which increases their drive & effort. \n\n   But don’t spoil them with fake compliments. \n\n   Or recognize mediocrity. \n\n   Doing so will backfire. \n\n   This is about honesty & rewarding the right people the right way. \n\n   Don’t Recognize For Results Only \n\n   There isn’t ALWAYS a direct relationship between results & efforts. \n\n   I used to only appreciate my sales VPs when we hit sales targets. \n\n   But something was missing. \n\n   I now appreciate results & efforts as the latter is fully in their control. \n\n   If I see someone genuinely give it their all w/ integrity they deserve to be seen. \n\n   Don’t Be Inauthentic With Your Recognition \n\n   We all know what fake recognition feels like. \n\n   And all it does is: \n\n   • Lead to lost trust \n   • Spread feelings of “blah” across the org \n   • Is received as an insult \n\n   Dig deep to find an authentic compliment. \n\n   If you can’t come up with anything don’t say anything. \n\n   No recognition > Inauthentic recognition. \n\n   Don’t Push Away Recognition. \n\n   True leaders don't seek accolades. \n\n   However when appreciation finds you: \n\n   • Accept it \n   • Say thank you \n   • Loop in others that deserve the praise too \n\n   Remember recognition isn't just about you—it's an acknowledgment of collective efforts. \n\n   The more people that can be brought into the praise (if authentic) the better. \n\n   Don’t Recognize People Only When They Agree With You \n\n   True leaders aren’t obsessed with being right or having their way. \n\n   They’re laser-focused on what’s best for the organization. \n\n   I love this Bezos quote: \n\n   \"I don't agree but I'm committed.\"\n\n   A testament to valuing collective progress over personal opinions. \n\n   Don’t Forget To Recognize Yourself. \n\n   It does not mean flattering yourself. \n\n   Instead acknowledge your wins. \n\n   Tell yourself: \n\n   • I am valuable \n   • I work hard with good intentions \n   • I am good enough \n\n   You can’t appreciate others if you don’t first appreciate yourself. \n\n   I appreciate the effort you put into reading this! \n\n   If you enjoyed this thread: \n\n   1.

Like usual they're thinking about\n   themselves.\" - Oprah Winfrey\n\n   When speaking don't think about yourself. \n\n   Think about your audience and providing maximum value to them. \n\n   If you're worried about you you’ve already lost. \n\n   Focus #1 = Tone & Body Language\n\n   \"Words mean little when the tone of voice is sharp.\" - Maya Angelou \n\n   Commented [1]: New section @sean@familyfund.vc\n\n   Maya Angelou knew words alone weren’t enough. Your tone and body language matter more. \n\n   • Vary your tone\n   • Use hand gestures to emphasize points\n   • Make eye contact with your audience\n\n   People will remember how you made them feel not what you said. \n\n   Empathize With Them\n\n   Before you speak to an audience ask: \n\n   • What is their biggest challenge? \n   • How can my knowledge offer a solution? \n\n   Martin Luther King Jr's words still live with us. \n\n   Why? Because his passion ignited change. \n\n   In his final speech he declared: \"I may not get there with you. But we as a people will get to the\n   promised land.\"\n\n   His passion united people for a common cause. \n\n   Show Your Passion\n\n   In 1933 the US was in an economic depression. \n\n   Roosevelt addressed the nation: \n\n   “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.”\n\n   Before you speak develop an undying passion for your message. \n\n   Inspire your audience. \n\n   People will feel your words only when you do. \n\n   Leverage Storytelling\n\n   \"During my lifetime I have dedicated myself to this struggle of the African people. I have fought\n   against white domination and I have fought against black domination.\"- Nelson Mandela. \n\n   From him we learn: \n\n   • Personal stories give powerful context \n   • Relate struggles to broader human experiences \n   • Position yourself within the story for authenticity \n\n   Your audience will remember the tales that resonate deep within. \n\n   Educate your Audience\n\n   Your audience is there to learn something not just to be moved. \n\n   End your speech with at least 1 or 2 takeaways the audience can walk away with. \n\n   Steve Jobs in his Stanford commencement speech shared the significance of connecting the\n   dots love and loss and the inevitability of death as a motivator for life. \n\n   Malala Yousafzai in her speech at the United Nations called for worldwide access to education \n   emphasizing that one child one teacher one book and one pen can change the world. \n\n   Make your words echo in their memory. \n\n   Make Conversation\n\n   What made Steve Jobs so good at speaking? His conversational tone. \n\n   He didn’t talk at people. \n\n   He talked WITH them. \n\n   How to talk with people? \n\n   • Use pronouns \n   • Don't read from a paper or PowerPoint slide \n   • Make eye contact w/ individuals in your audience \n\n   Note: When you connect w/ one person eye-to-eye many others will feel the same connection. \n\n   Have conversations not presentations. \n\n   Surprise Them\n\n   In his iconic speech Winston Churchill promised \"blood toil tears and sweat.\" \n\n   The unexpected intensity of his words gripped the nation. \n\n   By breaking expectations you captivate attention. \n\n   Like Churchill's unforgettable rhetoric surprise your audience and capture their attention. \n\n   Humor\n\n   \"I got my name from my father. And I got my accent from my mother.\"\n\n   Learning from Obama: \n\n   • Playfully address the elephant in the room \n   • Use humor to diffuse tension or scrutiny \n   • Engage with self-deprecation to humanize yourself\n\n   Laughter bridges gaps and builds rapport. \n\n   If\n",
